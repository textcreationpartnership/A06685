            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>diſcourſed, and publiſhed the excellencie of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and merits: Shee ſeemes to be ſparing of your prayſes, which are ſo juſtly due to you; For Experience hath now made me know a thouſand times more therof, then heretofore I heard or underſtood, becauſe I find ſo much benignity and goodneſſe among you, and eſpecially your Honours houſe, that I ſhould eſteem my ſelfe to be guilty of a baſe ingratitude, if I conſecrated not the remaynder of my dayes to the honour of your ſervice and commands; For I confeſſe, that this ſmall Preſent, which I now preſent and proffer you, cannot counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile or equalize thoſe ſublime favors; whereby you have eternally made me your debter.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Philoſophers, which entreat and diſcourſe of naturall cauſes, doe affirme, That the Sunne which makes the Raynebowe in the firmament, by the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and defuſion of his rayes, in a watry clowd diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to receive it; doth there forme and ingender this diverſity of colours ſo pleaſing to our ſight. Your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (my good Lord) is the Sunne of my happineſſe, and I am this clowd covered with the rayes of your favors, which makes all the world admire in me, the greatneſſe of your Generoſity, and the excellencie of your goodnes.</p>
            <p>But herein (notwithſtanding) conſiſts not my ſatisfaction, but rather your honor and glory, and as I deſire to publiſh that, ſo I likewiſe deſire to finde this; For I cannot live contented, if I made not a publique acknowledgement of thoſe many favours, whereby you have perfectly purchaſed and made me yours, and this Confeſsion conſiſteth in the oath of fidelity and obedience, which I have ſworne to the honour of
<pb facs="tcp:2870:2"/>your ſervice, and to teſtifie the immortality of my vowes, wherein with all poſsible humility I preſent you my ſelfe, and this ſmall Booke to your Honours feete; A worke proportionable to my weakeneſſe, but meerely diſproportionable to your Greatneſſe.</p>
            <p>If I am any way guilty herein, your goodneſſe is the true cauſe thereof; in regard it makes me beleeve that you will rather excuſe my Zeale, then accuſe or condemne my preſumption; and I doe promiſe my ſelfe this hope, and flatter my ſelfe with this confidence, that your Honour will partly excuſe this worke of mine, if it be not accuratly or delicately poliſhed, and that the will remayning where the power wants, is free and current payment with great and generous ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Some perchance may affirme and ſay, that I have diſcourſed and treated thoſe Matters with too much ſimplicity, which indeed is my only intent and deſigne. Becauſe my text and matter doe neceſſarily oblige and tye me thereunto, as alſo in regard I ever find the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way to be the beſt, for that the thornes of Studie and Schollerſhip, doe but ingage and ingulph our Wits in the labyrinth of inſupportable length and lauguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the which moſt commonly when we have all done and ranne thorow, wee in the end finde but a Minotaur of doubts, and a penſive melancholy anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie which devours them. My Lord, I have no other deſigne or ambition in this my Dedication, but to pay this tribute to your Honour, hoping that your charitie will cover my defects, and your goodneſſe over-vayle and pardon my weakeneſſe and imperfections.</p>
            <p>And my Lord, it is with all manner of right and reaſon, that I conſecrate and inſcribe this ſmall Worke
<pb facs="tcp:2870:3"/>of mine to your Honour, and place your Honourable name in the Frontiſpice thereof, as a bright Phare and relucent torch, which ſhall communicate and lend its luſtre and light, to make it ſee and ſalute the world.</p>
            <p>And ſo my good Lord, I will ſeeke my delights in the honour of your ſervice; my inclinations ſhall have no other centre, but the execution of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. My vowes and prayers ſhall be inceſſantly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth for your proſperities: and my Ambition ſhall never flye or ſoare higher, then to conſerue the honour of your favours, and to be both to your Honor, and to the young Noblemen your Sonnes,</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which in men changeth Reaſon, courteſie, and humanitie, into a wilde, fierce, and brutiſh nature, and which makes them leſſe pittifull then Lyons, and more to be feared then Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, is crueltie; that terrible vice the mother of cowardize, the ſpring of diſaſters, and the death of innocencie.</p>
               <p>For after a Coward hath once taſted of blood he delights in no other ſpectacle.</p>
               <p>It is the cauſe of miſchiefes, and of ſo manie fatall and mournefull accidents; for there being
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2870:4"/>a naturall Antipathy betweene that vice, and reaſon, ſhee expells reaſon; and therfore will not hearken unto her, in her furious, violent, and ſuddaine counſels.</p>
               <p>In a word, it is the death of innocencie, for to ſatisfie her bloody appetite, ſhee ſpareth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther age, nor ſexe, but upon the altar of her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and brutiſh paſſion, ſacrificeth as well the juſt, as the guilty, and would not ſpare her ſelfe if ſhee feared not the ſelfe ſame paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which ſhe inflicts on others.</p>
               <p>Now this vice is deteſted by noble ſpirits and generous ſoules, is abhorred by Angels, and in great abomination to God himſelfe; ſo by the law of contraries, mercie muſt be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and royall field, where we muſt abundantly reape the honour of men, the love of Angels, the graces and bleſſings of our heavenly Father, then muſt mercy be practiſed by men, admired by Angels; and bee delightfull to God, and therefore we ſee in our Text, that the beloved Sonne of eternity it ſelfe, Ieſus Chiſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to perfect his Apoſtles in the way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaith to them in generall, <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if hee had ſaid, I doe much hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre cruelty, that I deſire alſo that you that are my Diſciples, ſhould expell and baniſh it quite from your hearts, and thoughts, and in her roome to admit and entertaine mercy, that heavenly vertue, which I both eſteeme deerely, and love, and reſpect perfectly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:2870:4"/>You muſt therefore practiſe this eternally praiſe-worthy vertue, if you will be bleſſed; for it is impoſſible to get into my Fathers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, if you be not furniſhed and armed with mercie.</p>
               <p>You cannot aſcend to the top of felicity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have left ſinne, this heavie and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable burthen, I ſay, before you have received pardon, and abſolution for your faults, which you can never obtaine, before you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given your brethren their offences; before you have ſhewed your ſelves favourable and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to aſſiſt them; In a word, before you have extended and practiſed on them all ſorts of mildneſſe, clemencie, and meekeneſſe, which they ſhall ſtand in neede of, for I ſay vnto you, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they ſhall obtaine mercie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reade words like unto theſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.36. <hi>Be yee mercifull, as your Father is mercifull:</hi> And againe after, <hi>forgive and it ſhall be forgiven unto you; give and it ſhall be given unto you:</hi> And <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4. <hi>Be mercifull to the Orphans, be unto them a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to their mothers a husband, and then yee ſhall be the obedient ſonnes of the moſt high, who will yet more liberally diſtribute unto you his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:</hi> And <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. <hi>The ſoule that doth good, ſhall be exceedingly filled and repleniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a principle flowing from our nature, that we muſt not doe to another what we would not have done to our ſelves, from which principle is derived that golden ſentence of Chriſt. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2870:5"/>
                  <hi>With what meaſure you mete, it ſhall be againe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured unto you.</hi> And <hi>Iames</hi> 2. <hi>Condemnation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercie ſhall fall on them that have not uſed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and mercie is glorified againſt condemnation. Bleſſed then are the mercifull, for they ſhall obtaine mercie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words by Gods aſſiſtance, which wee to this end implore, wee will conſider, 1. Who be theſe <hi>mercifull.</hi> And 2. The reaſon why they are termed <hi>bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt, let us heare the ſacred voyce of the eternall Sonne of God, the Redeemer of our ſoules, ſaying in the firſt part of our Text, <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull,</hi> as if he had ſaid, O how great and altogether incomparable, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible are the favours, bleſſings, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces laid up for them that ſhall practiſe the works of mercie, they ſhall be Citizens of heaven, the Angels companions, and ſhall eternally enjoy and poſſeſſe in heaven, thoſe beatitudes which eye hath not ſeene, eare hath not heard, and that are not entred into the heart of man; and this is the recompence that God hath prepared for them which practiſe mercie.</p>
               <p>Now that we may the better know the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of this word, <hi>Mercifull,</hi> which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, or conjoyned, we will firſt conſider it in its abſtract, as the Philoſophers ſpeake, to wit, <hi>Mercie,</hi> which is commonly defined to be, A hearty griefe, or a ſorrow, for anothers miſerie, whom we aſſiſt and helpe with all our power.</p>
               <p>The object of it, is, the miſerie and affliction
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2870:5"/>of other, which makes her produce theſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pittifull effects, becauſe ſhee is unable to behold the ſore, without applying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</p>
               <p>God being one, cannot ſuffer any kinde of diviſion, there be no qualities nor accidents in him, but all things are eſſentiall in him, the Scripture to repreſent him unto us, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him all juſtice, and all mercie, ſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the fore-going maxime, wee cannot ſay, that mercie is one of his parts, ſeeing that being one, hee is indiviſible; but wee will more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſay, that he is <hi>Mercie</hi> it ſelfe, and therefore the faithfull that ſhall bee mercifull, that ſhall practiſe the works of charity, of clemencie, and meekeneſſe, may undoubtedly beleeve that they are the ſonnes of the moſt high, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto them a ray or ſparke of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite grace, and mercie, that ſo they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reſplend and ſhine with the ſame light with their heavenly Father, tread upon his ſteps, and be made like him as much as may be, <hi>Be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (ſaith Ieſus Christ) as your heavenly Father is mercifull,</hi> Luke 6.36.</p>
               <p>Mercie, ſaid an ancient Doctor, <hi>est fidei orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> it is the ornament of faith, for faith ſheweth her ſelfe by her fruits, which are pious and charitable works, and as trees are never ſo faire to behold, as when they are loaden and covered with fruits; ſo faith never appeareth ſo glorious, as when ſhe is adorned and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the ſweet and delightfull fruites of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2870:6"/>mercie; Hee called it againe <hi>ſalutis domicilium,</hi> the retreate and lodging of ſalvation, becauſe that when ſinners ſhall be called to give account of their actions before God, when God ſhall aske them, the reaſon of their adminiſtration, as that Lord in the Goſpell, then the ſhorteſt and ſafeſt remedie, is to flye to his mercie, and to aske him forgiveneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> that wiſe King, counſelleth us to make a carcanet of mercie, to put it about our necke, and that in this habit and ornament wee ſhall make the acceſſe of heaven free to our ſelves, finding grace before God, and men: and indeed it is one of the moſt pretious ſtones, and that is fit to beautifie and adorne the crowne of perfection it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Wee will therefore compare it to the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ſtone <hi>Irius,</hi> which repreſents the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours that appeare in the Raine-bowe, ſo the mercifull makes all ſorts of graces and bleſſings to ſhine upon his forehead, and to appeare in his actions; this Oppall ſtone <hi>Irius</hi> is greene, red, and white, the greene colour repreſents unto us that Hope which we have to finde grace before the ſoveraigne Iudge of our ſoules and bodies; The red colour repreſents unto us the pure blood of Chriſt, ſhed upon the Croſſe, to obtaine this grace for us, ſhe alſo denoteth unto us the redneſſe of our ſinnes, according to the Prophets phraſe, <hi>Though our ſinnes were as red as ſcarlet, they ſhall be made as white as ſnowe, Iſa.</hi> 1.18. and the white colour figureth unto us the divine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2870:6"/>juſtice, covered, and overcome by the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his mercie, as it is noted in the Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, that his white colour covereth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the red if faire weather be to follow; They marke beſides that this Oppall eaſeth the paines and labours of women with childe, ſo mercie lighteneth much the miſerie and griefe of the afflicted.</p>
               <p>We will here make no difficulty to uſe in this place the fabulous inventions of the Poets, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who tooke of <hi>Hiram</hi> (though a Pagan) all the wood, and ſtones needfull for the building of the temple.</p>
               <p>They uſually deſcribe <hi>Mercury</hi> (the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the imaginary Gods) with a wand in his hand, compoſed of hornes of plenty, wreathed with ſerpents, they alſo give him wings, with which he with incredible celerity, flyes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoever he is ſent.</p>
               <p>In this fable wee ſee a remarkable morall, which is, that it is a ſymbole of the Mercifull, who quickly and without delay takes pitie of the miſerie of others, according to this axiome, no leſſe common then true, <hi>Bis dat, qui cito dat,</hi> he giveth twice, that giveth ſpeedily. Secondly, he lives in all plenty and abundance, becauſe, that God bleſſeth him in all his goods, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Hee hath given largely to the poore, his righteouſneſſe remaineth for ever, his horne ſhall be exalted in glory, and he ſhall have whereof to lend, all the dayes of his life.</hi> Pſal. 112.9.</p>
               <p>The ſerpent uſeth once a yeare to caſt off his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2870:7"/>skinne, to aſſume another, that thereby he may be more healthfull and faire; ſo thoſe who are mercifull leave, and caſt off their wealth and ſubſtance, in favour of them that need it, that ſo they may appeare faire in the eye of the moſt high, give your almes, and all things ſhall bee cleane vnto you, putting off the old man.</p>
               <p>But that we may walke in the ſacred pathes of the holy Scripture, let us compare <hi>Mercie</hi> to the Serpentine rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, for if this had done many miracles in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that hath done as many wonders in the world: If this was called the finger of God, that is an excellent vertue, that maketh us come neare to God; but contrarily if the rod hath turned the waters into blood, <hi>Mercie</hi> turneth the blood of wrath into the water of mildneſſe, and manſuetude; If that hath cauſed darkneſſe, this bringeth light, if that wounds, this cures; In this they agree, that as the one divided the red Sea, to deliver the people from <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſlavery, ſo the other maketh us paſſe the red waters of Gods divine juſtice, to ſhunne the devils ſeizing of us, and to come to the Sanctuarie of caeleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all goodneſſe, according to the ſenſe of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude deſcribed in our Text, <hi>Bleſſed are the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, for they ſhall obtaine mercie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O happy and infinitely glorious (therefore) ſhall thoſe be, that uſe mercie towards their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted brethren, who open the boſome of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and reach out the hands of goodneſſe and compaſſion, to draw them to them, there and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2870:7"/>thereby to ſhelter them, from the miſeries and calamities that compaſſe them about; for when the ſoveraigne Iudge of our ſoules and bodies, ſhall come to keepe his Aſſiſes, when hee I ſay ſhall come accompanied with thouſand milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels, who are the Heraulds and great Officers of his divine Iuſtice, when heaven and earth ſhall ſhake before his face, when all the elements, and all the creatures together ſhall quake for feare in his preſence, when hee ſhall judge by an eternall decree the living and the dead, among all the moſt grievous and notable reproaches whereunto the wicked ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that of cruelty ſhall be the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he will not then ſo much taxe them of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beene theeves, drunkards, murtherers, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, as of not having beene pittifull to the poore and needie; <hi>Math.</hi> 25.42. <hi>Goe</hi> (will he ſay) <hi>ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the deuill and his angels, for I was hungry, and ye gave me not to eare, I was thirſtie, and ye gave me no drinke, I was naked, and you cloathed me not, I was in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But contrariwiſe hee will alter his voyce, when ſpeaking to his Elect, with a ſweet, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and gracious countenance, hee will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this favourable ſentence of congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, poſſeſſe the inheritance prepared for you before the foundation of the world, for I was hungrie, and ye gave mee to eate: I was thirſtie, and you gave mee drinke: I was naked, and you have cloathed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2870:8"/>mee: I was in priſon, and you have viſited mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The end, and center of the law of God, in the ſecond Table, is this, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbours as thy ſelfe:</hi> in theſe few words, wee ſee all the offices, all the duties, and all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which we owe to our neighbour, to wit, to love him as we love our ſelves, for as no man is ſo unnaturall (unleſſe hee hath loſt the uſe of reaſon, and be ready to precipitate himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſpaire) that would in his neede, for his good, refuſe himſelfe any thing that ſhould be in his power: ſo likewiſe, let us repreſent to our ſelues, that our neighbour is our other ſelfe, and that to refuſe him any needfull thing, yea, not to prevent him in his wants and incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, is a ſinne in him that is infected with it, which makes him unworthy to be compared or placed among the Pagans and Infidels, for they helpe one another with all their might: but with a great deale of reaſon and juſtice we may ſay, that he is farre worſe then a brute beaſt, for we may obſerue and marke, that thoſe of the ſame kinde helpe, and ſuccour one another; As we read in <hi>Plinie,</hi> that when a great and heavie Elephant is fallen, being for his heavineſſe not able to riſe, ſeeing ſpecially they have no joynts in their legges, his fellowes doe then aſſemble and raiſe him up with their ſnowts.</p>
               <p>It is noted, that when Stagges intend to ſwimme over ſome ſwift River, they gather themſelues together; and becauſe their heads laden with ſuch great hornes, would make them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2870:8"/>ſinke, they lay them on the hinder parts the one of the other, and becauſe the foremoſt hath no place to leane his upon, every one in his turne ſupplieth that place, and what ſhould wee not doe although we had no naturall affection; would not the very beaſts accuſe us of cruelty, and barbarouſneſſe, if being all to paſſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vaſt and deepe Ocean of this tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, in hope once to arrive in the delightfull Haven of ſalvation; If, I ſay, feeling our heads laden with ſo many miſeries, imperfections, and calamities, we did not mercifully aſſiſt and eaſe one another, and ſo wee ſhould not accompliſh the Apoſtles command, ſaying, <hi>Beare ye one anothers burthens, that you may fulfill the law of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> with his golden mouth as his name importeth) tells us in generall, that all men repreſent unto us but one body, whereof the greateſt and moſt honourable are like the braine, the eyes, the mouth, and the eares, and that ſo orderly according to their dignities, they poſſeſſe and take their place; and nevertheleſſe, there is ſo great an affinity betweene all theſe different members, that they all helpe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour one another; the eye helpeth the foot, and the foot ſerveth the eye; the mouth is ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the hand, and the hand to the mouth; and beſides, that experience teacheth us, that if there be the leaſt ach in the head, the face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth pale, the eyes often times flow with teares, and all the other members participate of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2870:9"/>her paines, according to the proverb, <hi>Quando caput dolet, caetera membra dolent.</hi> If the foot chance to tread upon a thorne, and to be pricked by it, the eye though farre diſtant ſeekes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the place offended; the backe ſtoopes, the hands runne to the place, and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in generall are attentive and carefull of the eaſing hereof: Alas! let us remember that wee are members of the ſame body, that wee owe our helpe and aſſiſtance one to another; when we ſee any in affliction among us, let us not ſtay ſo much to know the cauſe of his griefe, but that we may runne to apply the remedy to it, and to helpe him out of his wants and incommodities, and then by theſe actions we ſhall teſtifie, that we are the children of God, who ſaith, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.42. <hi>That if we give to the poore, a glaſſe of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his name, hee will hold it as done to himſelfe,</hi> ſo much doth hee delight in the holy and pious workes of mercie: <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>are the mercifull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mercie is compared to a tree, planted in the fruitfull ground of the hearts of the faithfull, that is watered by the wholeſome waters of bleſſing and grace, which the holy Ghoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſtilleth thereon, and upon which the Sunne of righteouſneſſe continually ſhineth, that ſo at all times he may beare abundantly the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and delectable fruits of charity, compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and meekeneſſe.</p>
               <p>This tree is divided into three branches, which we ſee is ſet forth unto us, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2870:9"/>of the firſt ſheweth us, that wee muſt not raſhly judge of our neighbour, but that wee judge of him charitably.</p>
               <p>The ſecond teacheth us, that wee muſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſtribute, and diſpoſe of our faculties in favour of the needy, that thereby wee muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their miſerie, and ſigh with them in their afflictions.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt branch, is; to forgive our enemies, and caſt away from us all deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in the Chapter before cited, after hee had exhorted us to bee mercifull, as our heavenly Father is mercifull, divideth this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie into three kindes, as we have already ſhewed, ſaying, firſt,
<list>
                     <item>1 <hi>Iudge not, and ye ſhall not be judged.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 <hi>Give, and it ſhall be given unto you.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3 <hi>Love your enemies, and ye ſhall be the children of the moſt high, for he is kinde unto the unkinde, and to the wieked.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Let us a while attentively conſider the three offices and duties of the mercifull, but rather let us practiſe them heartily, that we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed with the felicity promiſed unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they ſhall obtaine mercie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The corruption of this age is come to that height, that it ſeemeth that the beſt diſcourſe that men can finde, is to ſpeake ill of one, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from another, &amp; to judge ſo hardly of the beſt actions, that one might think them voyd of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2870:10"/>reaſon, and of the feare of God, and to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with the devill, in vexing and ſlandering the life of thoſe, who are good examples to all, and the ſubject of thankſgiving to all them that feare the Lord; and therefore the holy Ghoſt admoniſheth us in this firſt kinde of mercie not to be raſh in our judgements, leaſt we ſuffer the paines, and incurre the rigours of <hi>Talions</hi> law.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Iudge not, that ye be not judged.</hi> Math. 7.1.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt then obſerve theſe maximes in judging the actions of others, that if they be manifeſtly good, wee praiſe and imitate them, that thoſe that did them may be encouraged to continue, and that the wicked leaving their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wayes, may follow them, for examples move more then rules or precepts.</p>
               <p>If in all likelihood they may bee thought evill, nevertheleſſe wee muſt practiſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre on them the works of charity, and conſtrue them favourably, ſeeing that it is God alone who ſearcheth the hearts, and who trieth the reynes and thoughts, and who is onely able to judge of our good, or bad intentions, for now Satan transformeth himſelfe into an Angell of light, and hypocrites (his imitatours) doe ſo perfectly counterfeit the juſt, that it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſible to diſcerne truth from falſhood, Satan hath made them ſo deceiptfully crafty.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the juſt doe ſometimes commit actions, which ſeeme to be evill, and notwithſtanding are in themſelues very good,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2870:10"/>though they doe not appeare to bee ſuch, as when Chriſt was found alone ſpeaking with the Samaritane, but it was to teach her the way of Salvation.</p>
               <p>When hee delighted in the kiſſes of <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> who was ſo impudent in her life, and manners, in ſo much that the Phariſie that had invited him was offended at it, yet the end and the anſwer which Chriſt gave them made them thinke otherwiſe, when ſpeaking to the Phariſie, he ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.2.12.3. <hi>Simon, ſeest thou this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? I entered into thine houſe, and thou gaveſt mee no water to waſh my feete, but ſhee hath waſhed my feete with teares, and wiped than with the haires of her head. Thou gaveſt me no kiſſe, but ſhee ſince the time I came in hath not ceaſed to kiſſe my feete. Thou diddest not annoint my head with oyle, but ſhee hath annointed my feete with pretious oyntment. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay unto thee many ſinnes are forgiven her, for ſhee loved much, to whom a little is forgiven, he doth love a little. And he ſaid unto her, thy ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee,</hi> Luke 7.44, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ieſus Chriſt (take this example more) did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten eat with Publicans and ſinners, but it was purpoſely to convert them, and yet the Scribes and Phariſies that envied him, did not interpret it ſo, for they called him a glutton, a wine bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a friend of Publicans and ſinners, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.19. Behold how the beſt and wholeſomeſt meates are converted into ill humors by ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſtomacks, whence comes the proverb, <hi>Ictericis omnia videntur eſſe flavia,</hi> all things ſeeme
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2870:11"/>yellow to them that have the Iaundize, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked meaſure other by themſelues, and thinke that all imitate them in doing ill.</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch of this divine tree, is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Give, and it ſhall be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you,</hi> that is, that Ieſus Chriſt by theſe words exhorteth us, to diſtribute freely, and liberally of our meanes to the poore, aſſuring us to hold it as done to himſelfe, and that he will repay it a thouſand fold unto us, by giving us eternall life. <hi>Make you friends,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9. <hi>with the riches of iniquity, that when ye ſhall want, they may receive you into everlaſting habitations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ieſus Chriſt <hi>Math.</hi> 19.21. ſpeakes thus to a young man, that asked him what he ſhould doe to inherite eternall life, after he had bidden him keepe the commandements, he ſaith moreover unto him, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, goe ſell all that thou haſt, and give it to the poore, and then thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the chiefeſt lawes which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and recommended to his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was to be mercifull to the poore, and needy, as we reade <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.7. <hi>If one of thy brethren with thee be poore, within any of the gates of thy land, thou ſhalt not harden thine heart againſt him, nor ſhut thy hand from thy poore brother, but thou ſhalt open thine hand unto him, and ſhalt lend him ſufficient to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine his needs and wants, and let it not grieve thine heart to give it unto him, for becauſe of this the Lord thy God ſhall bleſſe thee in all thy works, and in all that thou putteſt thine hand to.</hi> And <hi>Prou.</hi> 28.27. <hi>Hee
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2870:11"/>that giveth unto the poore ſhall not lacke, but hee that hideth and ſhutteth his eyes from him, ſhall have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny curſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a wonder to ſee and behold the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects, and workes of the Almighty, that which commonly makes thoſe to abound in wealth, that beſtowe largely upon the poore, like a good ſpring or fountaine, which the more it is emptied, the more it overflowes in the excellencie of her waters; ſo the more the faithfull gives to the poore, the more God ſendeth his graces and bleſſings upon his wealth, ſo that the almes which hee gives are like ſeede fallen into good ground, which yeeldeth a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for one.</p>
               <p>It is like a little piece of leaven among a great deale of dowe, which raiſeth, and maketh it to encreaſe, and therefore the Wiſeman exhorteth us, to give the firſt of our fruits to the poore, and that the reſt will make our Barnes to overflow with plenty and abundance.</p>
               <p>The widdow of <hi>Sarephta,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. making a Cake for the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> with a little meale and ſome few drops of oyle, which onely were left unto her in that extreame famine, deſiring rather to obey the Prophet, then to ſatisfie her owne hunger, and that of her owne ſonne: but how can we produce this example without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring this her incomparable charity, to ſee the love of her ſelfe, the naturall affection ſhee bare to her deare, onely, and welbeloved child, give place to the pittie and compaſſion ſhee had of a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2870:12"/>Stranger, for the Prophet asking her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eate, ſhee anſwered, I have but a little oyle, and a little meale, which my ſonne and I will eate, and after wee ſhall die, ſhewing unto us, that the hopes of recovering any elſe-where would be vaine, and yet mercie paſſeth through all theſe difficulties, ſhee makes a Cake for the Prophet; but where is the recompence? it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth immediatly, as the ſhadow the body, that is, that during that extreame famine, ſhee wanted no meale, and her oyle was never dried up.</p>
               <p>Mercifull effects are commonly followed by thoſe which are miraculous; as we have already ſhewed, and as we could yet more largely ſhew, if wee did not feare to be too tedious; but let us ſee how God delighteth ſo much in mercie, that beſides that hee rewardeth it in this world with many temporall bleſſings, hee doth alſo ſhowre downe on the mercifull, his eternall and ſpirituall graces.</p>
               <p>In the 29. Chapter of <hi>Eccleſiasticus, Lay up thy treaſure according to the commandement of the moſt high, and it ſhall be more profitable to thee then gold, ſhut up mercie in thy Cabinets, and it will draw thee out of all affliction, the bounty of every one being ſhut up in him, as in a purſe ſhall conſerue his grace, as the apple of the eye, and at the end will give the reward unto every one.</hi> And <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.

               <p>But becauſe many ſeeke precautions, going about to practiſe the workes of charity, I will give my opinion upon this matter, that is, that we muſt not be like <hi>Martha,</hi> curious to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of ſo many things, but as Ieſus Chriſt, before whom there is no regard of perſons, but maketh his Sun equally to ſhine both on the juſt, and on the unjuſt, and maketh his raine to fall upon the good and bad, the Sunne ſhineth as well upon mud and dirt as upon Roſes on the valleyes, as on the mountaines; the raine fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth as well upon the rocks and ſands, as upon the good and fertile ground: ſo the mercifull whereſoever he ſeeth any calamity, he partaketh of it, and applieth the beſt remedie to it that poſſibly he can.</p>
               <p>Intention is the levell and ſquare wherewith all our actions are meaſured. It is the rule to meaſure them; the touchſtone to know their value: Havens and Harbours receive as well the broken and torne pieces of a ſhipwrack, as a great and rich lading in a good veſſell; the earth which is the mother and cradle of all mortall men, receiveth equally <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>Dives, Irus,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus, Diogenes,</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the mercifull muſt alwayes propoſe this object to himſelfe, to obey Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in aſſiſting the poore, and in comforting and conſolating the afflicted, without ſearching
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2870:13"/>further if he be worthy or not of your compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if it be his lazineſſe, or his folly that have made him miſerable; theſe things are not to be examined by you, it belongeth to God to judge of it, and to you to obey Gods holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>Ieſus Chriſt being here on earth, exerciſed his charity on all thoſe that asked it of him: He fed ſeverall times great multitudes: Hee healed the ſicke: He made the lame walke, the blinde ſee, and that at the firſt requeſt, without further enquiring.</p>
               <p>Mercie is the banke and haven of miſerie, if thou receive the unworthy, after thou ſhalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the worthy: <hi>Abraham</hi> making an Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall of his tent, received therein all Strangers indifferently that came to him, and in practiſing this courteous and bountifull hoſpitality, hee received Angels into his houſe: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 13. biddeth us forget not hoſpitality, for ſome have lodged Angels, not knowing it. <hi>When thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is hungry, give him to eate, and to him that asketh give,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Math. Chap.</hi> 4. The devill ſeeing that Chriſt was hungry, asked him if hee were the Sonne of God: you likewiſe when you ſee the poore languiſhing and ſtarving at your doores, ſuccour him quickly, and aske him not if he be the child of God, if he be an honeſt man and worthy of your almes, becauſe that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.41. <hi>He that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, ſhall receive a Prophets reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:2870:13"/>The good <hi>Tobias</hi> finding any of his brethren lying dead in the middeſt of the ſtreetes, uſed to riſe from his bed, and left his meales to come and burie him.</p>

               <p>From all theſe examples we muſt draw this wholeſome doctrine, That there is no vertue that makes us ſo conformable and delightfull to our heavenly Father, as <hi>Mercie,</hi> and therefore that wee beare not wrongfully the title of the ſonnes of God, let us extend our liberalities to the poore; Let us give them cheerefully, and without grudging or enquiring, the firſt and beſt of our almes deedes, let us not ſtay to bee troubled with their cries.</p>
               <p>The Iſraelitiſh women at the firſt asking of <hi>Aaron</hi> diſpoiled themſelues of their Rings, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canets, and Iewels to make that Idoll, the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. and ſhould wee be able to ſtop our eares, and not to heare thoſe pittifull and lamentable cries of Chriſt, ſpeaking by the mouthes of the poore, uſe charity, give and it ſhall be given unto you: thoſe almes or benefits which are done either by importunity, or by force, or for ſhame, deſerue not the name of <hi>Mercie:</hi> thinke you that it was a great favour which the wicked and malicious Iewes did to Chriſt, to give him gall and vineger to drinke,

               <p>What then is that Tyger, and Dragon-like courage, tempered in the water of eagernes, and cruelty, that is not penetrable to the ſhot of theſe powerfull reaſons, who is ſo unnaturall as to behold with dry eyes a poore Chriſtian lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing for hunger, ſtarved with cold, and full of wounds, and doth not give him bread to eat, calleth him not into his houſe to warme him; and that like the Samaritane, powreth not oyle into his wounds, what Adamantine heart is ſo hardned, as not to open and cleave with griefe, at the object of ſuch pittifull ſpectacles, and ſights.</p>

               <p>It is one of the moſt pious and generous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſoule, to take upon her the afflictions of others, and to eaſe them of them: It is the ſacrifice the moſt delightfull, with which the Lord is pleaſed, they are <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> ragges, but they draw us from the Cave of ſinne, from the pit of iniquity; it is the dry rock of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Horeb,</hi> from whence flowes aboundantly the wholeſome waters of grace, and bleſſing.</p>

And indeed this part of mercie doth greatly beautifie, and make glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious her body; for her two ſiſters, Pitie in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and Compaſſion in condoling, are actions which humanity cannot refuſe, to the lamentable cries of the languiſhing, to the ſad and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full objects of poore and miſerable men, but muſt move your hearts were they of ſteele, and draw teares from your eyes, though they were of marble.</p>
               <p>But to forgive our enemies, is to vanquiſh and overcome our ſelues, it is a nearer approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the divine nature, then to the humane.</p>
               <p>All Hiſtories are full of charitable actions of men towards their neighbours, and without taking them out of Scripture, the examples are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2870:15"/>(thankes be to God) uſually to be ſeene, but to forgive our enemies, not to annoy them when it is in our power, is to be enlightned by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred preſence of the holy Ghoſt, to be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by his grace, to bee fully poſſeſſed of mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> (that great ſervant of God) who had beheld him face to face, that had ſeene him practiſe this rare and excellent vertue, towards the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> falling into Idolatry; Hee that had mediated for them, ſpeaking to God after this manner: O Lord what will thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſay, that thou haſt brought thy people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by a ſtrong hand and ſtretched out arme, to kill them in the wilderneſſe, ſeeing that thou couldeſt not bring them into the land which thou diddeſt promiſe them, and himſelfe notwithſtanding is carried away by this paſſion of revenge, when hee made the earth open and ſwallow vp alive <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> with their families, though it bee not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they had participated in the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their heads; yea, he did not ſpare <hi>Mary</hi> his owne ſiſter, whom he covered with lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Neither is it to the purpoſe to ſay that it was in Gods cauſe that hee uſed this revenge, that is vallable in putting <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> to death, becauſe they had violated the divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; God forbid that I ſhould excuſe their fault, but I deſire onely to ſhew, that though <hi>Moſes</hi> were ſo holy a man, yet hee had ſome touch of humane weakeneſſe.</p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:2870:16"/>But in this circumſtance what ſhall wee ſay of <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods owne heart, that ſo often curſeth his enemies, that giveth charge to <hi>Salomon</hi> his ſonne, to revenge him of the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and curſes which <hi>Shimhi</hi> had ſpoken againſt him, as he fled from before <hi>Abſalom.</hi>

               <p>And the Apoſtles themſelues having not beene well received in a certaine place, ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Wilt thou that we make fire fall from heauen, upon that Citie? but Ieſus diverted and hindered them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee produce all theſe examples not to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; but to ſhunne them, and thereby to make it appeare that wee muſt not revenge our ſelues when wee can doe it, but rather to doe good to our enemies, when they have done us hurt, is to make our ſelues perfect in this excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Mercy. It is to becom conformable to the Saviour and Redeemer of our ſoules, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and feeling the horrible cruelties of the Iewes againſt him, hearing the blaſphemies which they pronounced againſt his divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, notwithſtanding in ſtead of revenging himſelfe, he prayeth his Father, and crieth out thus, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they doe.</hi>

               <p>Let us uſe the ſame Doctrine, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the prophane mouth of a Papan, they are nevertheleſſe of infallible truth, as a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond looſeth nothing of his value, though it be in the dirt: let us then practiſe it, and let us remember, that whileſt we deſire to puniſh our enemies, wee doe them a great favour, and are

               <p>In theſe words to obtaine mercie, wee have many very remarkable circumſtances, for God will ſhew himſelfe ſuch unto us, as wee ſhall ſhew our ſelues to our neighbours, if wee give
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2870:19"/>a crumme of bread to the poore languiſhing at our doores, hee will call us into his royall Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; hee will make us ſit downe at his Table, he will fill us with the dainties of his houſe, and will make us drinke abundantly in the river of his delights, if wee beare with griefe our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours affliction, if wee dreſſe his wounds, and powre oyle on them; hee will comfort us in our ſorrowes, hee will wipe off the teares from our eyes, and will fill our hearts with joy and gladneſſe, if wee forgive our brethren their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, when either maliciouſly, or through infirmity they have offended us, hee promiſeth and aſſureth us, to be ſo bountifull and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to us, that hee will drive our ſinnes away from before his face; hee will ſcatter our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes like a cloud diſperſed by the parching beames of the Sunne, and in this part ſhall wee finde the center where the fulneſſe of our felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie reſteth and reſideth.</p>
               <p>This forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes is, that which covereth us from the divine juſtice, that giveth into our hands the ſhield of aſſurance, which is impenetrable by the revenging ſhot of his juſt judgements, that maketh us walke voyd of feare towards the throne of grace, and that without the leaſt doubting, for ſince God is with us, who ſhall be againſt us? ſhall the world, why it is vanquiſhed? ſhall hell, why it is fettered and ſhackled? Shall death, why it is dead? ſhall ſinne, why it is prevented and pardoned? Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, ſhall the fleſh, why it is crucified? Wee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2870:20"/>may therefore ſay and conclude with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint <hi>Paul, O death where is thy ſting, O hell where is thy victory? now thanks be to God that hath given us victory through his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this word <hi>obtaine,</hi> wee will alſo derive and draw this remarkable doctrine, for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth asking, ſeeing wee cannot obtaine a thing before wee have demaunded it, which teacheth us our duties towards God, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our ſelues poore, weake, and miſerable, both in body and ſoule, ſubject in body to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſickneſſes, weakneſſes, and neceſſities, troubled in minde with a world of buſineſſe, croſſes, and afflictions, and ſo laden in ſoule with ſinnes, miſdeedes, and iniquities, that they are more in number then the ſand that is on the Sea ſhore; But the onely remedy to theſe ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes is, to have our recourſe to Gods mercie, which is the ſacred anchor of our hopes, the haven of our ſalvation, and the eternall reſidence of our incomparable, and incomprehenſible fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities.</p>
               <p>Arid let us hold for certaine and infallible, that wee ſhall never bee refuſed by his ſacred goodneſſe, which calleth out aloud unto us, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are troubled, and heavie laden, and I will eaſe you: take my yoake upon you, for it is light, and ye ſhall finde reſt to your ſoules;</hi> his yoake is nothing elſe, but the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, weakeneſſe, and neceſſity of the poore, that is the yoake he commandeth us to beare, that is to ſay, we muſt take off the loade of miſery and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2870:20"/>calamity from the poore, to lade it upon our owne ſhoulders, and wee ſhall finde that his yoake is eaſie, and his burthen light, becauſe he will then augment our ſtrength, and will make us ſo able to beare it, that we ſhould be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ever to caſt it off againe.</p>
               <p>As a King findeth the waight of a crowne but ſmall, when it is upon his head, by reaſon of the wealth, honour, and power that follow the heavineſſe of this burthen, as hee would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave his Kingdome, his power, and his Empire, for the waight of a Scepter, ſeeing they make him honourable to his Subjects, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Strangers, ſo that faithfull man which hath compaſſed and environed his forehead with the crowne of love to his neighbour, that hath adorned his hand with the Scepter of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to the needy, and miſerable, hee without doubt ſhall finde reſt in his ſoule, which is the fulneſſe of all felicity.</p>
               <p>Now ſince ſuch great and admirable effects, ſince ſo excellent profits and advantages, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from our mercie, charity, and bounty to our neighbour, ſince in the practiſe of it, wee finde our felicity, which conſiſteth in the love which God beareth unto us, in the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pardon for our offences; ſince againe God aſſureth us, that the charity which we give and exerciſe to our neighbours, hee will accept as done to himſelfe: alas, who would be ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, and hardened with rigour; who would be ſo defiled with ingratitude, that having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2870:21"/>favours from a King, would yet refuſe to obey him, and to ſerue him with all his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhould not hee be worthy of the greateſt torments, of the moſt cruell puniſhments, that have ever beene imagined; would not the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the elements, and all the creatures together riſe up to judgement, to aske puniſhment for ſo grievous a crime; ſince it is moſt true, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude is the baſeſt and damnableſt vice, that can infect the ſoule of man.</p>
               <p>Let us remember that we have nothing but what we haue received of our heavenly Father; and if wee have received it from his favourable and fatherly hand, why ſhould wee be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, as to refuſe him a ſmall portion of it, when hee asketh for it: Now, and at all times when we heare and ſee the poore praying, and crying unto us in the ſtreetes, or at our doores, it is the voyce of God himſelfe, that calleth us to acknowledge his benefits, as often as wee ſee one afflicted that asketh us helpe, and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; let us runne to him, and give him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of joy, and gladneſſe, for it is Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe which was comforted by an Angell in the Garden, when praying to God his Father, hee ſweated drops of blood, which made him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce theſe lamentable words, ſo full of griefe; <hi>My ſoule is full of ſorrow even unto death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we have bin offended by our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and that he will caſt himſelfe at our feete, to aske us forgiveneſſe, let us not be ſuch ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ſo unnaturall, as to refuſe him his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2870:21"/>remembring that it is a condition need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to obtaine the pardon for our owne ſinnes, which wee ſhall never obtaine, untill wee have firſt forgiven our brethren their offences: but let us follow the example of our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who ſaith, <hi>That at what time ſo ever a ſinner repenteth him of his ſinnes, he will put away his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe out of his remembrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when wee muſt appeare before the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and dreadfull Throne of the Soveraigne Iudge, when wee ſhall be called to a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the talents and adminiſtration which hath beene committed to our charge by our heavenly Maſter: let us then I ſay follow the example of that wiſe Steward, let us make our ſelues friends with the riches of iniquity; let us fill the hand of the poore, which is the Altar of God, upon the which hee affectionatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the Incenſe of our prayers, as a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pleaſing Sacrifice, to the glory of his holy name.</p>
               <p>Then I ſay, ſhall wee heare that ſweet and heavenly voyce of the Saviour of our ſoules, ſpeaking graciouſly to us after this manner: <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you, before the foundation of the world. Amen. Amen.</hi>

                  <p>O Lord God, full of mercy and compaſſion, O favourable Father, that art the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of pardon and remiſſion, and the refuge of them that truely repent, who deſireſt not the death of a ſinner, but rather that hee may turne from his wickedneſſe and live; wee thy poore and miſerable creatures, who by the weaknes of our fleſh, by the malice of our mindes, &amp; by our owne vitious inclination to follow ill examples, have provoked thee to make thy wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation fall upon our ſinfull heads; we have many wayes and times by our tranſgreſſions incited thee, to caſt upon our ſinfull ſoules the thunderbolts of thy judgements, we have made ſinne our delight, and iniquity the height of our happineſſe. Thy juſtice did cry and runne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us, like a roaring and ravening Lyon ſeeking to devoure us, thy judgements were ready to caſt our bodies and ſoules into hell, but that the excellent greatneſſe of thy mercie, (O bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and gracious Father) hath interpoſed her ſelfe, and hath not permitted that we ſhould be caſt downe into the depth of eternall death, and condemnation; thy hand (O ſweet Saviour) hath upheld us, and thy clemencie (O our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer) hath perfectly delivered us: therefore (O gracious Father) ſeeing thou haſt preſerued us from evill, conſerue us ſtill in good things, receive (if ſuch be thy good pleaſure)the incenſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2870:22"/>of our prayers, our ſacrifice of thankeſgiving, which wee moſt humbly offer upon the ſacred Altar of thy divine compaſſions. Put up our teares into thy bottels, accept our contrite hearts broken with griefe, to have offended thee, for a pleaſing Sacrifice: receive our griefes and diſpleaſures for thy ſatisfaction, and behold thy Sonne, thy onely, thy welbeloved Sonne, his head pricked with thornes, for our ſinnes, his hands, his ſides, and his feete pierced with Lances, and nayles for our iniquities, for his torments ſake, for his paines, and for his deaths ſake, reſtore us unto life, forgive us our ſinnes, (O great God) blot out our iniquities, that ſo following thy example, wee may doe the like to them that have offended us; change in us our hard hearts, and make them gentle and eaſie to pardon and forgive; and ſuffer not our ſoules to be defiled, and infected with the venome of revenge: but that leaving it unto thee, we may thinke of nothing elſe but to be obedient unto thee, bleſſing thoſe that curſe us, ſpeaking well of thoſe that ſlaunder us, and praying for thoſe that perſecute us.</p>
                  <p>O good God, kindle in our ſoules an holy love towards our afflicted brethren, that wee may partake with them in their afflictions, and ſo eaſe them that they may the better beare that burthen, which thou haſt impoſed upon them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the holy and ſacred Temple of wiſe King <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> there were three things chiefely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that is, 1. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the temple whereto the people came. 2. The holy place appointed for the Levites, and thoſe that miniſtred at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. And 3. the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> or the moſt holy place, conſecrated for the Arke of the Lord, who had appointed it for his ordinarie dwelling and reſidence, wherein he commonly appeared, in the forme of a darke clowd, out of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2870:24"/>which were heard, the divine Oracles, and the irrevocable ſentences of his ſacred judgements. It was a place whereinto none (upon paine of death) could come, except the high Prieſt, and that but onely once every yeare, and yet with many precautions, and circumſtances, for hee was firſt to purifie himſelfe, to waſh his body, and to change his cloathes, before he appeared in the terrible and fearefull preſence of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.</p>
               <p>By this faire and meruailous Temple of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> is lively repreſented unto us the world, adorned, and diverſified with ſo many faire and admirable creatures.</p>
               <p>By the Body of the Temple, where the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> heard the reading of the law of God, his Spouſe the Church is naturally deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and figured unto us.</p>
               <p>By the holy place, whereunto came onely the Levites, and thoſe which miniſtred at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, are ſignified unto us, <hi>the Miniſters of the word of God,</hi> who are choſen and put a part in his Church, to be Heraulds, and Embaſſadours of his holy will, offering the ordinary Sacrifices of prayer and thankſgiving, which are his delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and well accepted ſervice.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> or the moſt holy place, is truly figured unto us Heaven; for, as the high Prieſt entred not into that place, before he had firſt purified, &amp; waſhed himſelfe according to the Divine ordinance: ſo the faithfull cannot enter into heaven, untill hee hath firſt diveſted
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2870:24"/>ſinne, and be covered with the cloake of Iuſtice, holineſſe, and innocencie; therfore Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe declareth the ſame thing unto us with his owne ſacred mouth, ſaying,</p>

                  <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth exceeding well the ſame words, in the 15. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Lord, who ſhall abide in thy Tabernacle? who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill? he that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteouſneſſe, and ſpeaketh the truth in his heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the 24. <hi>Pſalme, Who ſhall aſcend into the hill of the Lord? and who ſhall ſtand in his holy place? hee that hath cleane hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his ſoule unto vanity, nor ſworne deceitfully.

               </p>
               <p>And in the 33. Chap. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ver. 14. <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? who amongſt us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings? He that walketh righteouſly, and ſpeaketh uprightly: he that deſpiſeth the gaine of oppreſsions, that ſhaketh his hands from receiving of bribes; that ſtoppeth his eares from hearing of blood, and ſhutteth his eyes from ſeeing evill. He ſhall dwell on high: his place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſhall be the munitions of rockes, bread ſhall be given him, his waters ſhall be ſure.

                  <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Words very energetically and ſignificant, as if hee had ſaid, Dearely beloved, the onely and perfect way to poſſeſſe all happineſſe, all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and all the advantages that you can wiſh; and in a word, to enjoy eternall felicity, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template face to face Gods divine Majeſtie, wherein conſiſteth the fulneſſe of happineſſe, and all contentment, following the ſerpents ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to caſt off the olde skinne, that is, to pull off the olde coate of ſinne, infected with the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie of iniquity, to fly and eſchew evill, to embrace good, to hate vice, and perfectly to love vertue, which is the true way to heaven, to the poſſeſſion of heavenly graces; and in a word, to the fulneſſe and perfection of all true happineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed are then the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to enter into a more particular expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe words, we will divide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two principall parts, and will conſider, 1. who are the pure in heart. And ſecondly, the cauſe why they are bleſſed.</p>
               <p>The royall Prophet <hi>David</hi> in the 15. <hi>Pſalme,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:2870:25"/>deſcribeth perfectly unto us thoſe that are pure in heart, <hi>They are thoſe,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that lye not, and who live uprightly; they who backbite not with their tongues, nor doe evill to their neighbours, and in whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned, but they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them that feare the Lord: they that ſweare to their owne hurt, and change not: they that put not out their money to uſurie, nor take bribes or reward againſt the innocent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a very faire, true, and ample deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Righteous man, who hath a pure heart, that is, who hath his conſcience pure and juſt, and who lives in integrity, juſtice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie.</p>
               <p>For this word <hi>heart,</hi> is not here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood or taken for the materiall &amp; carnall heart, placed in our breaſts, which is the fountaine and beginning of life, the firſt living, the laſt dying in man, but for the ſoule that keepeth there her ordinary Seſſions, as we commonly ſay that is corne, by ſhowing onely the ſacks that hold it; there is the Kings Treaſure, by ſhewing onely the Exchequer Chamber where it is kept, the place containing being called and taken by the name of the thing contained: ſo muſt we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a pure heart to bee taken for the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which therein makes her reſidence.</p>
               <p>Where at the firſt ſight we finde a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable, and worthy our conſideration, that to wit, that ſinne being as it were a black and venomous Inke, or an infect d and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted poyſon, as ſoone as it comes neare our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2870:26"/>hearts, the ſeate of our ſoules, it defileth, infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, and makes them ſo ſtinking, that God cannot endure them before his face, ſo much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth he the very ſent and ſmell of ſin, and ſo much the very object of iniquity is noyſome and troubleſome to him.</p>
               <p>Now Ieſus Chriſt knowing that man brought into the world from his mothers wombe with life, the cauſe of death, that is, originall ſinne, curſed ſinne, a diſaſtrous blade or ſtalke, which like the wilde and evill plants caſteth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally forth ſo many young ſprigges, which doth ſo people and ſtore the field of our ſoules, that in the end in ſtead of a Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> where God tooke pleaſure to walke, in ſtead of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull River, where the Angels bathed, it be comes a hideous and dreadfull wilderneſſe, where the devils and wicked ſpirits keepe their Sabaths, and criminall Aſſiſes and Seſſions, a filthy ſinke, where wicked and impious men like Hogges continually wallowe: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ieſus Chriſt (I ſay) to bring his Apoſtles to perfection, and to put them and all the faithfull in the way to heaven, he exhorts them to keepe their hearts pure, cleane, and naked from all ſinne, filthineſſe, and iniquity, to extirpate the thiſtles, &amp; bryers from the fields of their ſoules, to plow and till it carefully, with the ſhare and harrow of contrition and repentance for their ſinnes: In a word, to make it aground fit, and fruitfull to receive the holy ſeed of the word of life, and to make it beare fruites to immortality and eternall life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:2870:26"/>As men would bee curious to ſweepe and cleanſe a houſe, wherein a King reſolues for a while to be reſident, and may juſtly accuſe him of imprudence and impudence, who having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and notice of his comming, would not make haſt to perfume it, to adorne, and enrich it with the faireſt furniture, to embelliſh it with all the rarities and moſt pretious jewels they could recover: So, alas! the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are nothing elſe but the houſe of God, the glorious throne of his beloved Sonne, and the tabernacle which the holy Ghoſt hath choſen for his habitation; where is then that heart of ſtone, that ſoule ſo baſe, and obſtinately reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bee loſt, that knowing the happy and moſt honourable arrivall of the great King of Kings, of the three divine perſons, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable and incomprehenſible Trinity, and trine-unity, doth not ſweepe and cleanſe the houſe of his heart, and doth not purifie it from all dirt and filthineſſe, who I ſay will not adorne it with the richeſt treaſures, and with the rich or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments that holineſſe, juſtice, and innocencie abundantly affords; purpoſely to receive with honour and reverence ſo magnificent a King, who promiſeth us to come unto us, when hee ſaith in the 14.

               <p>The cleareſt waters are alwayes the beſt, and therefore commonly ſee that the excellenteſt ſprings are derived from the rockes, and fetch'd from the higheſt hills, becauſe that the water diſtilling through many narrow paſſages, and ſtrait places, the farther it goes the more it is purified, &amp; the moſt ſubtill and cleareſt ſprings ſeeke the higheſt places, as approaching nea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rer to the nature of the ayre, whoſe nature and propriety is ſtill to aſcend. And contrariwiſe, you may obſerve and marke, that the thick and heavie waters are alwayes filthy and ſtinking, and are conſerved in pitts and deepe ſinkes, as participating of the nature of the earth, and therefore are fit for nothing but to breed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and Frogges, whereof ſome kill us by their mortall venome, and the other trouble us with their unſufferable croaking.</p>
               <p>Theſe cleare and pure waters doe lively prefigure and ſet forth unto us, the faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord, who hath purified, and as it were diſtilled himſelfe at the fire of the love of God, thereby to leave off what was earthly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2870:28"/>ponderous, and troubleſome in him, as hatred, ambition, ſenſuality, and vaine glory purpoſely to ſoare aloft, and to elevate himſelfe to the holy mountaine of <hi>Syon</hi> towards heaven, which is the center whither the circumference of his deſires, deſignes, and thoughts tendeth.</p>
               <p>Theſe black and muddy waters may expreſſe and ſet forth hell unto us, where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but horrible darkneſſe and fearefull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, where that old ſerpent is iuſtly baniſhed for his deſerts, and where the damned, gaſtly, and frightfull ſoules doe nothing elſe but vexe themſelves and curſe.</p>
               <p>But to apply it to the ſubject of our text, theſe ſtinking and corrupted waters, may very fitly be compared to the wicked, and to the men of this world, who have Woolfes or Lyons hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhape and forme of men, who wallowe like Hogges in the mire, and dirt of carnall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, who runne not after pietie and vertue, but remaine faſt chained and bound to ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and vice; caſting all their affections on the earth, whereof their body is made and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, never ayming nor levelling their thoughts at heaven, whence their ſoule had their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; True ſerpents in malice, hatred, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, that with mortall venome infect the Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Roſes of the beſt conſciences, Frogges in prating and ſlandering, that never open their mouthes, but to utter unſufferable blaſphemies, oathes, lyes, and detractions.</p>
               <p>Take yet this farther conceit upon the purity
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2870:28"/>of the heart, to wit, that as the eyes ore-vayled with clowds, or with cataracts and webbs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not clearely diſcerne the objects, or colours, which are expoſed before them, becauſe their faculty is prevented and hindered, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of theſe obſtacles, which are placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the object and the ſight; whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe good ſound and well diſpoſed eyes as are theſe of Eagles, who though ſoaring in the higheſt clowds, doe nevertheleſſe ſee very plainely in the thickeſt buſhes, in the remoteſt furrowes of the farre diſtant fields, and which is moſt admirable, is, that her ſight is ſo ſtrong and powerfull, that contrary to the nature and practiſe of other living creatures, ſhe can ſteddily behold and contemplate the Sunne, without winking at all; yea, when ſhee is neareſt him, and ſtanding on the higheſt branch of a tree, planted on the top of the loftieſt mountaine.</p>
               <p>Now to appropriate this to our matter, wee ſay, That hee whoſe heart is incombred with the things of this world, whoſe ſoule is ore-vayled with ambition, with the clowds of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and vaine glory, whoſe conſcience is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, and darkned with hatred, envie, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, can never contemplate God, nor ſee his face, which is all the conſolation, all the joy, and in a word, the true center of our happineſſe, the fulneſſe of all our felicity, and the greateſt delights which the faithfull can wiſh or deſire. But thoſe that ſhall be carefull and diligent to keepe their ſoules pure and cleane from the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2870:29"/>of ſinne, thoſe like Eagles indeede al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waves ſoaring in heavenly and godly actions, ſhall be perched and placed in the higheſt place of mount <hi>Syon,</hi> from thence-forth ever to view the heavenly Sunne riſing, that beareth health in his rayes and wings, to behold ſteddily, and without winking, the gliſtering, and bright ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning beames of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, without any feare of hurt, being aſſured of his wonderfull favour, manifeſted by his inviolable promiſes, for he ſaith in our Text,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this purity of heart, we may underſtand the ſimplicity of our lives and actions, and ſo this ſentence, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart,</hi> may be this interpreted, Bleſſed are thoſe that walke ſimple in their actions, whoſe heart is voyd of fraud, and of any thoughts of iniquity, whoſe tongue ſpeakes nothing but the hearts meaning, that ſhunnes vanity, and the glory of this world, that ſo they may be perfectly glorious in that which is to come. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Serm.

               </p>
               <p>And therefore Chriſt ſending through all the world, to publiſh the Goſpell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, the redemption of captive ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2870:29"/>from the chaines and torments of hell, and to preach openly the acceptable yeare of the Lord, ſaith unto them; <hi>Behold I ſend you forth as ſheepe in the midſt of Woolves, be ye therefore wiſe as ſerpents, and harmeleſſe and innocent as Doves;</hi> as we read in the 10. Chap. of S. <hi>Math.</hi> ver. 16. And in the ſame Goſpell, Chap. 6. ver. 22. <hi>The light of the body is the eye, if therefore thine eye be ſingle, thy whole body ſhall be full of light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſo excellent vertue of meekeneſſe and ſimplicity, hath alwayes beene hated of the world, as being contrary to the vanity and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of it, and the high way to mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> there to ſee God face to face as <hi>Moſes,</hi> who preferred the ſimplicity of a Shepheards crooke, to the honours, riches, and preferments which hee might juſtly have expected in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, as being reputed his daughters ſonne.</p>
               <p>This vertue cannot but be very pleaſing to God, ſince he himſelfe hath put it in practiſe, in appearing to <hi>Moſes</hi> in a buſh, which is a baſe and abject plant, deſpiſing the lofty Pine trees, and Cedars of <hi>Libanus,</hi> which in height and beauty exceed all other trees of the earth.</p>
               <p>The Angels alſo have practiſed it, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left the heavens to appeare unto men, they have not taken the forme and majeſtie of Kings, to be reſpected of all, but rather the habit of Pilgrimes, and men of baſe quality, to teach us to ſhunne pride and vaine glory, and to ſhew us by their cloathes that we are Strangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes in this world, that our houſes are but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2870:30"/>Innes, where we ſhould ſtay onely as poſts doe under a tree till the ſtorme be paſt, and ſo to continue our way as long as the day of our life ſhineth, that the night envelloping and wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping us up in her darke cloake, wee may arrive at the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> which is our native Country from whence we firſt departed.</p>
               <p>We read in the 18. Chap. of <hi>Geneſ.</hi> That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſitting at his tent doore, ſaw three men paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that way, whom hee called, and deſired to come and ſit under a tree with him, to eate a morſell of bread, to comfort their hearts. Now if it were God himſelfe in the forme of three men, to repreſent the three perſons of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, or if they were Angels ſent by him, is a queſtion out of the ſubject of our Text; but becauſe many Fathers of the Church are of the ſecond opinion, we alſo will hold it, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the 13. Chap. to the <hi>Heb. Be not forgetfull to entertaine Strangers, for thereby ſome have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Angels unawares, which is commonly refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this action of the Father of the faithfull, and of</hi> Lot <hi>his brothers ſonne, who alſo entertained in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome two Angels, in the ſhape of Strangers, and of men that were travelling further.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 5. Chap. of <hi>Tobit</hi> wee reade, that the Angell <hi>Raphael</hi> appeared to the young <hi>Tobit,</hi> and offered to bring him into <hi>Media,</hi> which hee did afterwards performe.</p>
               <p>But leaving many other examples, which we could alledge of the humility, and ſimplicity of Angels; let us briefly runne over the lives of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2870:30"/>Patriarks &amp; Prophets, where the ſimplicity and innocent purity of their actions doe moſt lively appeare. <hi>Abraham</hi> at Gods command, without any further information, goeth to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, to ſacrifice on an Altar his onely ſonne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaack</hi> following the ſteps of his Fathers obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, runnes to his death, never fearing the great torment that he was ready to endure, layeth the wood on his ſhoulders, and carrieth in his hand that fire that was appointed to burne him to aſhes; yea, hee encourageth his poore old Father to execute Gods divine command, reſtores unto him by his exhortation, his ſtrength already loſt, by reaſon of the extreame griefe which he endured, to be the executioner of his owne ſonne, and to kill him to whom hee had lately given life.</p>
               <p>But leaſt we ſhould be too tedious, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſimplicity ſhall ſerve us for all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as being the moſt remarkable that can be ever rehearſed by man; and indeed was it not a great and lofty myſterie, that God ſhould give ſo reſolute a courage, ſo great a conſtancie, to the Father of the faithfull, and ſo admirable boldneſſe to this obedient ſonne; for <hi>Abraham</hi> repreſenteth unto us God the Father, who to execute the irrevocable decree of his divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, hath ſeiſed the ſword of his terrible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to dip it in the blood of the ſpotleſſe Lambe, that bare the ſinnes of the world on the Altar of the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:2870:31"/>This ſweet Ieſus, whoſe ſimplicity, and meekeneſſe are both peereleſſe &amp; inexplicable, this good Saviour, following the example of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> by whom during the ſhadowes of the law hee was figured, goeth freely to his death, bearing the wood, which was to bereave him of life upon him, and within him the burning fire of love, that inflamed him with an infinite affection to ſave the Elect: Hee was brought ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> as a Lamb to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo opened he not his mouth to complain: he is conducted as a dumbe Sheepe before her Shearer: but in that we ſee nothing but part of his ſimplicity, appearing in the cataſtrophe of his actions, when he was neare his death; but if we ſhould curiouſly view the acts of his life, beginning from his birth, we ſhould be raviſhed in admiration of theſe infinite wonders; but let us conſider only in generall, that he is borne of a pure virgin, eſpouſed to a Carpenter: was that befitting his excellent Majeſtie, who was the King of the world?</p>
               <p>Hee was borne in a Stable amongſt beaſts, judge if that were the Royall Pallaces, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable company, which hee had in heaven among the Angels.</p>
               <p>He was ſwadled in clowts, and laid in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for want of a Cradle, to keepe him from the injuries of the weather: were thoſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of his Paradiſe?</p>
               <p>He was fugitive here and there, to ſhunne the envie and furious rage of <hi>Herod,</hi> who ſought to kill him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:2870:31"/>In a word, conſidering diligently all the courſe of his life, from the moment of his birth, to the laſt period of his death, wee ſhall finde all his actions framed in humility, and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by meekeneſſe and ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>This example and no more, he did not goe chuſe within the Pallaces of Kings, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and gallanteſt Courtiers; hee did not elect the ſonnes of Princes to be his Apoſtles, but went to the receipt of cuſtome, to the Cottages and Boats of Fiſhermen, to call that honourable company of his twelue Apoſtles, who like well inſtructed Diſciples followed the ſteps of their loving Lord and Maſter; ſo well did they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and follow his examples, and eſpecially that of his ſimplicity, that they may be patterns of it themſelues, as the Hiſtory of their life ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſheweth, and as the duty of their place required, for men being deepely plunged in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, preſumption, and arrogancie, there was no way to vanquiſh them, but wholy by contrary weapons to them unknowne, that they might the more eaſily be ſubdued and vanquiſhed.</p>
               <p>To their arrogancie, they oppoſed meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to their pompe and vaine glory, humility, and ſimplicity, ever remembring the command of their good Maſter, <hi>Be ye ſimple as Doves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is remarkable, that the faithfull, and ſuch as walke uprightly before God, are called by the wicked, and by the children of the God of this world, <hi>Poore and ſimple people,</hi> becauſe they addict not themſelves to fraud and deceit,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2870:32"/>ſo ſpake <hi>Iobs</hi> wife to her husband, being yet in affliction upon his dunghill, <hi>Doeſt thou ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thine integrity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Ieſus Chriſt to ſhew us that hee approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thoſe whom the world rejecteth, ſpeakes as if he had ſaid, <hi>See you thoſe ſimple and baſe people, they ſhall ſee God:</hi> So Chriſt gives them hopes of the bleſſed viſion of God, as if hee had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed light to the blinde, knowledge to the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and wiſedome to fooles, for ſo this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked world calleth thoſe that will not drinke the cop of his malice, nor tread in his pathes full of ſinne and iniquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed then are the pure in heart, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He doeth not onely ſay, they ſhall be bleſſed, but he ſpeaketh in the preſent tenſe, ſaying, they are already bleſſed: for God having given them that holineſſe which they poſſeſſe, and upon all occaſions practiſe, hath alſo given them two ſtrong and well feathered wings, to ſoare and flie aloft to heaven: whereof the one is faith, by the which the juſt truſting and repoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholy in the promiſes of Chriſt, takes his flight towards Paradiſe, to have a taſt of them; for it is the nature of faith (as appeareth by her definition) to know how to aſſure it ſelfe, how to aske the grace of God promiſed in his word, how to embrace ſalvation offered by Ieſus Chriſt, and during this life, how to poſſeſſe in part that eternall and bleſſed life.</p>
               <p>And becauſe faith beginneth here to taſt the delights of the viſion of God, ſhe is yet upheld
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2870:32"/>and fortified by <hi>Hope,</hi> which is the ſecond wing, that makes her expect heaven, and promiſeth her abſolutely to fill her abundantly with thoſe ſweet pleaſures whereof ſhe hath, ſhee yet had but a taſt, and to make her perfectly know, that which now ſhe ſeeth but obſcurely, and like a ſhadow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart: for they ſhall ſee GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon theſe words there is an objection to be reſolved, why Chriſt ſaith here <hi>the pure in heart,</hi> ſeeing the Scripture in many places is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to this juſtice, to this purity, to this cleaneneſſe, as we read <hi>Prou.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay I have made my heart cleane, I am pure from my ſinne?</hi> And in the firſt booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> the 8. Chap. <hi>There is no man that ſinneth not.</hi> And in the 1. Epiſt. of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. Chap. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſinne, we deceive our ſelues, and the truth is not in us.</hi> And in the 25. Chap. of <hi>Iob, How can man be juſtified with God: or how can he be cleane that is borne of a woman?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although theſe places, and many more (that we purpoſely leave to avoyd prolixity) ſeeme to be oppoſite to our Text, notwithſtanding we will reconcile them together.</p>
               <p>For when the Spirit of God calleth heere thoſe that live juſtly and holily pure in heart, we muſt not underſtand it ſo, as if they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and abſolutely cleane from the filthineſſe of ſinne; for in that ſence the royall Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is none juſt, no not one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:2870:33"/>But we muſt underſtand here thoſe that ſtrive to walke in the ſacred pathes of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, that live holily before God, and without reproach before men, that have beene purified, like gold tried ſeaven times in the fire, and that fire is the word of God, that enters and penetrates to the moſt ſecret thoughts, there to conſume the wood and chaffe of our wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</p>
               <p>This cleanſing and purification is clearely ſet forth unto us in the 15. Chap. of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Now ye are cleane through the word which I have ſpoken.</hi> And in the 13. Chap. ver. 10. of the ſame Goſpell, <hi>Hee that is waſhed, needeth not ſave to waſh his feete, but is cleane every whit: and ye are cleave, but not all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, the faithfull that live holily, may be called juſt and pure in heart, <hi>Secundum quid, non ſimpliciter,</hi> Iuſt in that degree of Iuſtice that may fall on man whileſt he is here below figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt fleſh and blood his domeſticall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that often overcome him, and would quite keepe him downe if hee were not upheld and fortified by the ſpirit of grace and by the Almighty hand of God that raiſeth and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth him.</p>
               <p>The faithfull ſervant of the Lord is againe called pure in heart, becauſe hee is ſuch in part already, and that beſides the great diſpoſition that is in him to tend to his perfection, hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready here begins to taſt the excellent ſweetnes of that delicate fruit whereof he ſhall hereafter
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2870:33"/>be fully and perfectly ſatisfied and ſatiated in Gods Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed then are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee have another circumſtance here very pregnant and remarkable, to wit, that Chriſt exhorteth us here to be pure in heart, and not of our head, or hands, becauſe that the heart being the ſeate of the ſoule, ſinne is moſt buſie to viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and infect it with his foule and filthy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which it doth not in the other parts of the body, and therefore you ſee that God doth ſo ſtrictly command us to keepe our hearts for his part and behoofe, ſaying, <hi>My ſonne give mee thy heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to omit or let paſſe nothing worthy conſideration like the inhabitants of <hi>Nilus,</hi> wee will draw water in running.</p>
               <p>We ſay then that this word heart, is diverſly taken in the Scripture, Firſt, is taken for faith, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>For with the heart man beleeveth unto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſsion is made unto ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is taken for the thoughts, and for the gift of regeneration, as 1. Epiſt. of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Chap. 3. ver. 4. <hi>The hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meeke and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price and eſtimation.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2870:34"/>and ſacrifices wherein hee delighteth.</p>
               <p>The Etymologiſts hold, that this word <hi>Cor</hi> is derived of <hi>Cura,</hi> that is, care, becauſe that part communicateth, ſendeth, and doth diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute blood and life to the reſt of the body: Even ſo all our ſtudy, all our exerciſe, and occupation ſhould be to ſeeke the meanes fit for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our ſoules: <hi>for what will it profit a man if hee gaine the whole world, and looſe his ſoule. Math.</hi> 16.26.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as the Embrion is conceived, the firſt part which is formed is the heart, being as it were the center whence the ſeverall lines are drawne to the circumference of our bodies, it is alſo the firſt member living, and when the paines of death have compaſſed a man, the blood from all parts retires to the heart, as to a citadell, ſo that it is alſo the laſt part that dieth in us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that common ſaying, <hi>Cor eſt primum vivens, &amp; ultimum moriens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when the faithfull of the Lord reſolveth to live piouſly, he muſt caſt for a ſure and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able foundation, the righteouſneſſe of a pure and cleane conſcience, which muſt be the Ocean where all the rivers of his affections muſt runne and tend, the corner and fundamentall ſtone, on the which muſt be edified this his Pilgrimage: All the building of this mortall and tranſitorie life, muſt begin with the juſt mans beginning, and never end till his death, when it ſhall bee augmented and perfected in heaven.</p>
               <p>It was Gods commandement under the law,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2870:35"/>that all Iſraelites, all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould offer and conſecrate to him the firſt borne, both of man and beaſt; now if wee unvayle the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and conſider what it therein figured unto us, we may note among other things, that God deſired by this Decree, whoſe letter and figure is abrogated, though the truth and ſence of it be eternall, that wee ſhould offer and conſecrate unto him our hearts, which are the firſt borne of our ſelues.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of Phyſitians hold, that the ſoule being generally all over the body, hath her principall ſeat in the heart, as the King hath in his Court, although his power reach tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all his Kingdome; ſo that the ſoule being that very man which God requireth, it is then not without reaſon, that God demandeth our heart, which is her throne: <hi>My ſonne give me thy heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The heart is knowne to bee the originall of naturall heat; now God being a burning fire of love, and affection towards his children, wee ought to conſecrate that part to him for his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.</p>
               <p>The heart is red and bloody, to ſhew us the fervencie and zeale that ſhould be in us to Gods ſervice and glory, and that our thoughts ſhould alwayes burne with love to him, and with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to our neighbours.</p>
               <p>It is little; whence wee may learne not to puffe, or ſwell it with pride, but to keepe it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes humble and modeſt. Vertues that ſeeke

               </p>
               <p>The heart is agitated by a continuall motion, by reaſon of his vitall ſpirits, that animate and nouriſh it: So our thoughts ſhould beare and conduct us to the actions of Iuſtice, innocencie, and godlineſſe, and to follow the ſteps of the Scripture, Charity alwayes worketh, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver idle, by reaſon of the ſpirit of grace dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in our ſoules, who inſpires continually in us holy and religious thoughts.</p>
               <p>There is but one heart in man, and yet his ſhape and forme is triangular, a figure bearing proportion to his object, that is God, one in Eſſence, and three in perſons: So our ſoules ſhould bee adorned with theſe three beautifull vertues, Faith, hope and Charity.</p>
               <p>He is open at the top, and that way he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his nouriſhment: Which teacheth us, that our ſoules ſhould alwayes be open, to proclaime the praiſes of our Creator and Redeemer, that nouriſheth them with the holy and wholſome meat of his ſacred word, ſent downe from heaven.</p>
               <p>The leaſt angle or corner is turned downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to ſhew us that our leaſt care ſhould bee for earthly things.</p>

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:2870:36"/>It is againe not hayrie, to teach us that our ſoule which is his hoſteſſe, muſt be voyd of the fooliſh and light imaginations, of the weake and unconſtant conſiderations of this world, that ſo ſhe may hope and ayme at nothing but heaven, her bleſſed Countrey, wherein it is impoſſible to enter, before our heart (after <hi>Moſes</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) have pulled off the Shooes of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and worldly affection, that ſo wee may come neare this burning buſh, this fearefull fire, Gods divine juſtice.</p>
               <p>The Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> being once enquired, what was the moſt pleaſingſt thing of God; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ordinary manner hee anſwered ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and obſcurely:</p>
               <p>

                     </gap>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An anſwer moſt true, though it came from the father of lies, for a <hi>C</hi> is the halfe of a Sphere, an <hi>O</hi> is a Sphere, and the beginning of the word <hi>Rome,</hi> is an <hi>R,</hi> which letters put together make <hi>COR,</hi> that is, the heart, and queſtionleſſe it is the moſt pleaſingſt gift that can bee offered unto God, and which no man can juſtly refuſe him. The poore may ſay, I cannot give almes; the ſicke I cannot goe to Church, I can neither watch nor pray; but none can ſay, I cannot love God, for thy other defects may be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thy poverty, or ſickneſſe, but to refuſe God with thy heart it cannot be excuſed but by malice, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> very learnedly ſaith.</p>
               <p>Let us remember that how charitable ſo ever our actions be, if our heart doe not goe before
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2870:36"/>to enlighten them, all of them will tumble downe together into the obſcure darkneſſe of the deepe.</p>
               <p>Our actions are of no value without the heart, but the heart may bee good without the actions; God had reſpect to <hi>Abel,</hi> and afterwards to his offering; the good Thiefe to obtaine mercy gave nothing but his heart; <hi>Marie Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene</hi> but her teares, and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> but ſighes and lamentations, proceeding from the depth of his ſoule.</p>
               <p>Now that this heart may be pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, it muſt be cleare, bright, and ſhining, to the end that as in a glaſſe God may ſee his owne image and likeneſſe after which he at the firſt created it, and when it is once cleane and pure, then right ſo, and in that manner, we muſt keepe it in the ſame glorious eſtate, for</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non minor eſt virtus quam quaerere, parta tueri.</hi> And to that end we muſt imitate the Bees, which to hinder the drones and ſpiders from comming into their Hives, to corrupt or devoure their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſtop the entries of them with bitter and ſtinging hearbs, as good Husbandmen who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe their grounds, leſt paſſengers or the wild beaſts ſhould ſpoile them. Even ſo ſhould wee alwayes keepe the paſſages of our ſenſes, of our hearts, and of our thoughts, fenced with the feare of God, which is a bitter Rue, and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, that the devill cannot endure to taſt or reliſh.</p>
               <p>Marke and obſerve with me the care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2870:37"/>which is uſed to conſerve Chriſtall, and <hi>China</hi> Diſhes, what paines are taken to keepe them cleane, bright, and ſhining, becauſe they are deare and rare. And what can wee finde in this world more precious and rare then our heart, then let us with a diligent care, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſollicitude, ſeeke the cleaneneſſe and purity thereof, following the Apoſtles counſell, <hi>Let every one poſſeſſe his veſſell with ſanctification, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.4.</p>
               <p>When a veſſell is cleft or crack, it is unfit to containe any liquid thing; <hi>Now the wicked heart is a crackt veſſell,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eccles. chap.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>A broken heart threatneth death to a living creature, as a Ship ſplit and torne with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the waves, threatneth undoubted death, ruine and ſhipwrack; ſo that heart that is not well united to God, that is broken and ſhattered by the force of worldly affections, threatneth and fore-telleth an infallible ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>To fill a veſſell in a Well or in a Fountaine, we muſt needs bend it downwards; ſo muſt we humble our heart, to fill it with heavenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>I have enclined my care, and I have received wiſedome,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Sap.</hi> 61.</p>
               <p>Againe, we know, that none can fill a veſſell with any good and wholeſome liquor, wherein there is ſome corrupted, before he firſt empty it, and make it very cleane: If we deſire to fill our hearts with the love and other graces of God, wee muſt firſt expell and exempt the love and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2870:37"/>delights of this world, that have beene ſo long reſident there, and then when wee have done thoſe things, we ſhall be ſure fully to enjoy the ineſtimable effects of this divine promiſe.</p>

                  <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart: for they ſhall ſee GOD.</hi>

               <p>In this ſecond part wee have demonſtrated unto us the reaſon, why Chriſt calleth the pure in heart <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> it is ſaith he, <hi>becauſe they ſhall ſee GOD.</hi>

               <p>This conjunction, for, joyning thoſe two ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, ſheweth and marketh out unto us the reaſon of this felicity, and happineſſe, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive a name enough emphaticall, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant to repreſent to our ſenſes, and to our underſtandings, the leaſt beame, the leaſt ſpark, the leaſt drop of that inexhauſtible Ocean of that devouring fire, of that Sunne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whoſe brightneſſe if we ſhould undertake to contemplate, it would ſtrike us blinde, whoſe immenſe depth if wee ſhould ſearch, it would ſwallow us up, whoſe burning heat if wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, it would convert us to aſhes, and would make us pay deere for our curioſity.</p>
               <p>The Poets faine, that the Giants attempting to clime up to heaven, were thunder-ſtricken, as they were heaping <hi>Olympus,</hi> and <hi>Pelion</hi> upon <hi>Oſſa,</hi> one mountaine upon another: A fable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from that truth taught us in the Scripture, touching the building of the Tower of <hi>Babell,</hi> whoſe Builders were ſhamefully confounded; the Allegorie of this truth, the morality of this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2870:38"/>fable ſets forth unto us the curioſity of them, who thinking to pierce too farre into Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, are caſt downe into a deepe Abiſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, by their audacious preſumption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Empedocles</hi> deſiring to know the cauſe why mount <hi>Aetna</hi> did caſt forth ſuch flames, was ſwallowed and devoured by them.</p>
               <p>God indeed depreſſeth, and dejecteth the proud deſignes of thoſe that are ſo raſh, as to diſcourſe of that which is altogether ineffable, and incomprehenſible, but yet is ſo gracious and favourable, that he enlightneth and fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe, that with feare &amp; humility approach the greatneſſe of his myſteries, as <hi>David</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Serue the Lord in feare, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce with trembling:</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſonne, <hi>Thoſe that truſt in the Lord, ſhall underſtand the truth: and the faithfull ſhall know hit love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then with the ſpirit of feare, and humility, we are to ſeeke after this hidden glory, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vayle of faith, which teacheth us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the things which wee ſee not, nor cannot be the object of our ſenſes, Hope will make us deſire them, Charity to love them, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious goodneſſe of God will helpe us to attaine them.</p>

               <p>The infinite greatneſſe of this divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, whoſe performance is infallible, makes us skip and leape for joy, charmeth our ſenſes, and raviſheth our mindes, for it ſeemeth altogether impoſſible, that living tombes, mortall carcaſſes, the prey of death, and the foode of wormes, ſhould ever aſpire ſo high, as to pretend to ſee and view that felicity which is better deſcribed by ſilence, and admiration, then by any other deſcription, <hi>for they are things which eye hath not ſeene, eare hath not heard, and that are not entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of man, which God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</p>

               <p>In the 33. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Exod. ver.</hi> 20.

               <p>Wee with one conſent ſaid, <hi>That God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible;</hi> which ſeemeth to be oppoſite, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the promiſe made unto us in our Text, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart: for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, to reconcile them together, for the holy Ghoſt is never contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; wee ſay that the places before alledged are ſo to bee underſtood, that whileſt man is in this mortall priſon, in this valley of teares ſo obſcure, and darke, whileſt like an Owle he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in the night of ſinne, his eyes can no way endure the leaſt beames of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, for God being an infinite Spirit, cannot be ſeene by a finite body; but when we ſhall leave off this mortall priſon of our bodies, our ſoules then perfectly enlightened by the heavenly grace, ſhall be endued with that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and faculty, that they ſhall openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template their Creator, and their God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Chap. Now wee ſee through a glaſſe darkely, but then wee ſhall ſee him face to face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word <hi>See God,</hi> is much controverted among Divines, which be of two ſeverall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; whereof the one holdeth, That ſoules delivered of this corporall vayle, cannot ſee Gods face, for two reaſons; the firſt is, that God being a ſpirituall Eſſence, infinite, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, cannot bee ſeene by a finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2870:39"/>without implying contradiction, for then the containing, to wit, the bleſſed ſoule ſhould bee greater then the contained, that is, God, which is abſurd, by this axiome, that the object is contained by the viſuall faculty: As if a man placed in the midſt of the earth, or of the ſea, looking round about a great diſtance off, as farre as his ſight could reach, could not for all that ſay, That hee ſaw all the earth, or all the ſea.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the ſecond opinion anſwere to this firſt reaſon, ſaying, That the Creator may not be compared with the creatures, that God is all in all, and all, and whole in every part, that hee is one, and conſequently indiviſible; that all things in him are Eſſentiall, and is not ſubject to diviſion, that whoſoever ſeeth him, ſeeth him totally.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon of the firſt, is, that wee meaſure our ſoules by our bodies, imagining that they ſhall have eyes, with the which they ſhall be able to diſcerne and diſtinguiſh the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent objects.</p>
               <p>To which the others anſwere, that indeede the ſoules in heaven ſhall have no corporall eyes like ours; but that notwithſtanding God will give them a ſeeing faculty, by the which they ſhall perceive the preſent objects: 2. When theſe ſoules ſhall be rejoyned, and revnited to their bodies, God having purified them from all vncleaneneſſe, will make them like unto the glorious body of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2870:40"/>Lord, who ſaith, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. <hi>That our bodies ſhall be as the Angels of God in heaven, who alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of God, Math.</hi> 18. that is, <hi>that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his preſence, and that ſee him perfectly,</hi> in reſpect of themſelues, as much as it pleaſed God to permit, but not perfectly in reſpect of God, as he that ſeeth the Sunne, may ſay, that hee ſeeth it perfectly, in reſpect of himſelfe, if his faculty be good, and notwithſtanding he cannot ſee him as he is, becauſe of the weakeneſſe of his eyes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond opinion which is more generally received, holdeth, that this word <hi>See,</hi> is taken ſimply, and abſolutely, for to <hi>Know,</hi> and thoſe that hold it, ſay, That Ieſus Chriſt in our Text promiſeth to the pure in heart, a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the divine goodneſſe; wherein conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fulneſſe of our felicity, of our delights, and content, which they doe well proove by the 14. Chap. of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>If ye had knowne me, ye ſhould have knowne my Father alſo, and from henceforth ye know him, and have ſeene him;</hi> where Chriſt ſheweth to his Diſciples, that they have ſeene his Father, becauſe they have knowne him by ſo many miracles done before their eyes. And in the 17. Chap. of the ſame Goſpell, <hi>This is life eternall, that they might know thee the onely true God, and Ieſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> where it plainely appeareth, that this word to <hi>know God,</hi> is as much as to poſſeſſe life eternall.</p>
               <p>And ſo from thoſe two places joyned to our Text, this concluſion followeth, that, <hi>To ſee God, know God, and have eternall life, are the ſame thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:2870:40"/>As the Angels then ſee the face of God, even ſo ſhall we alſo ſee it, for that bleſſed ſight is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for a recompence of our faith, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 1. Epiſt. 3. Chap. <hi>When he ſhall appeare we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him face to face.</hi>

               <p>Not that we muſt imagine, that God hath any members, although it be ſaid, that man is made in the image of God, for that is thus to be underſtood, that man hath beene created in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect juſtice, and innocencie, after the example of God.</p>
               <p>But by this face of God, we muſt vnderſtand with the Scripture, the Church, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and namely Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his booke <hi>Decivit. Dei,</hi> the manifeſtation of his glory, and a perfect knowledge of his wonderfull mercie, which he will communicate unto vs.</p>
               <p>It is a hard queſtion, and difficult to handle, Whether the Saints after the Reſurrection ſhall ſee God with their corporall eyes, after they be glorified; ſo <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>In my fleſh I ſee God:</hi> there <hi>Iob</hi> propheſieth the Reſurrection of his body: but hee doth not ſay, I will ſee him by my fleſh; and if he had, it might have beene underſtood of Chriſt, that ſhall come at the laſt judgement in the ſight of all; but his meaning was, that when hee ſhould ſee God, hee ſhould be in his fleſh, though the wormes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had devoured it.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is excellent upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſaying, We ſhall ſee God with our corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall glorified eyes, as we ſee the life of a man by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2870:41"/>his living actions, not ſeeing life it ſelfe; ſo is it likely, that being enlightened by a heavenly and divine light, we ſhall be able to ſee the Creator of all things both in them, and himſelfe, ſo doubtfully the learnedſt ſpeake of it.</p>
               <p>In the 5 Chap. of the 2. booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> we reade, that <hi>Eliſha</hi> after that he had healed <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the Syrian, ſaw <hi>Gehazi</hi> his ſervant take Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents from him, although hee were beyond the common reach of the ſight; and when <hi>Gehazi</hi> was returned, hee ſaid unto him, <hi>Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned againe from his Charet to meet thee.</hi> Now if this Prophet hath bin able to ſee the actions of his ſervant, although abſent from him, how much more ſhall our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified bodies ſee all, when God ſhal be all in all.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaw this action of his ſervant, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a ſpeciall revelation from God, or by the ſight of a ſpirituall imagination of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that ſhewed him the thing, after which manner he knew the moſt ſecret counſells of the King of <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſpeake of theſe things, as blind men doe or colours, wee finde no certainty of them any where, the Fathers themſelues ſpeake ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely of them, they goe as ſoftly on, in the handling of this queſtion, as if they trod on thornes, they grope along, as if they went in the obſcure darknes of the blackeſt night, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can you finde two agreeing together, and which is more ſtrange, not one that is agreed with himſelfe; and indeed how ſhould a worme
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2870:41"/>of the earth, the dwelling of errours, the ſubject of ignorance, know or comprehend that great God, which is the fountaine of all knowledge, and the bottomleſſe and ſhoreleſſe Ocean of wiſedome, and prudence.</p>
               <p>It is true, that when our ſoules ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with that eternall happines, &amp; that they ſhal enjoy the divine viſion, in which conſiſteth our chiefeſt felicity, we ſhall then ſee God as he is, but to conceive and comprehend the infinity of his being, it will be altogether impoſſible to us.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that ſayle in the maine Sea, which way ſoever they looke, finde no other object but the heaven, or the waves, their ſight being too weake to penetrate to the bottome, or to view the ſhores; Even ſo ſhall we ſee God, and know him as farre as it ſhall pleaſe him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us, but ſo farre ſhall wee be from compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading him, that he doth comprehend us, and wee ſhould then be no more ſeene there then a drop of wine in the Ocean.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Baſile</hi> handling this queſtion in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Eumonius,</hi> hath an excellent compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from the leaſt to the greateſt, If we cannot comprehend the compoſition of a Piſmire, for the ſmalneſſe of it, how ſhall wee comprehend the infinite greatneſſe of God.</p>
               <p>We ſhall comprehend it indeede, but it ſhall be as a ſpunge caſt into the Ocean, which is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led quite with water, but is overcome, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed round about by it.</p>
               <p>I ſhould want time rather then matter, to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2870:42"/>ſpeake on a ſubject ſo high, and excellent, wee ſhould never have done if we ſhould propound, and reſolue the infinite number of arguments, and opinions moved upon this queſtion of our ſight of God.</p>
               <p>But for us, let us hold as the Mathematicians doe, <hi>linea recta eſt breviſsima,</hi> that the ſtraiteſt line is the ſhorteſt, and in this the ſhorteſt way is the ſureſt: let us turne neither to the right hand, nor to the left, from the certaine way of truth, taught unto us by the truth it ſelfe, to wit, by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in our Text, ſaying,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart: for they ſhall ſee GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us then purifie our hearts, and cleanſe our ſoules, from the filthineſſe of ſinne, and from the ſpots of iniquity; let our conſciences bee white as ſnow, and cleane as waſhed wooll; let us take the firme and inviolable oath of Allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to our God, and let us not ſuffer Satan our mortall enemie to take poſſeſſion of the fort of our ſoules, of the hill of <hi>Syon,</hi> that is of our conſciences: let us not ſuffer him to make a breach in that vow, that we vowed to his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience at our firſt reception into the Church by Baptiſme, and ſo wee ſhall be waſhed ſeaven times in the Iordan of repentance, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition for our faults; when we have put on the white roabes of holineſſe, juſtice, and innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, we ſhall be invited to the Lambs wedding, we ſhall ſit downe at table with the Kings ſonne, wee ſhall be abundantly filled with the dainties
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2870:42"/>of his houſe, and ſhall drinke in the river of his delights.</p>
               <p>In a word, when like the high Prieſt we have left off the habits of our naturall corruption, and put on the white and cleane garment of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification for our ſelues, of love for our God, of charity for our neighbour; then, even then, the gate of the moſt holy place, which is heaven ſhall be opened unto us, wee ſhall ſee Gods Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, not darkly, and as in a clowd, as it hath long appeared to our fore fathers, but rather as a bright ſhining Sunne, whoſe vertue ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten us, whoſe love ſhall warme us, and whoſe compaſſions ſhall animate us, at whoſe ſight wee ſhall be vivified, conſolated, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>
               <p>For hee will enrowle us among his Angels, will make us Citizens of heaven, and impatriate us to be abſolute poſſeſſors of the rich treaſures of eternall life, where it is farre eaſier to know what is not there, then to diſcourſe what is.</p>
               <p>There, there is no death, no wearineſſe, no infirmity, no hunger, no thirſt, no heat, no cold, no corruption, no want, no mourning, nor ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Wee have told you what there is not there, but what there is there, <hi>eye hath not ſeene, eare hath not heard, neither is it entred into the heart of man, what God hath prepared for them that love him:</hi> now becauſe theſe joyes and felicities have not entred into the heart of man, therefore man muſt ſtrive to enter into them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:2870:43"/>God ſpeakes thus by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> 32. <hi>My people ſhall dwell in a peaceable habitatoin, and in ſure dwellings, and in quiet reſting places.</hi> In this bleſſed life there is a certaine aſſurance, a ſure tranquillity, a happy eternity, an eternall happineſſe, a perfect charity, a perpetuall day, a quick motion; in a word, all ſhall be there led, and governed by the ſame Spirit.</p>
               <p>Here let us burne with zeale to aſcend to thoſe faire places; let us be enflamed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame deſire of poſſeſſing ſo goodly an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and if our bodies cannot as yet goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet let our hearts aſcend up, if our ſoule be as yet bound and faſtned within this mortall priſon; at the leaſt, let our faith flie up to thoſe delicious places , and there reſt and ſtay untill our ſoules be perfectly pure, cleane, and white, that one day both in body and ſoule, wee may contemplate Gods divine Majeſtie, and ſing eternally with the holy Angels, <hi>Holy, holy is the Lord God of hoſts for evermore.</hi> AMEN.</p>
               <p>O Moſt bountifull God, and moſt mercifull King, wee thy ſervants and children here proſtrate and humbled before the high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tribunall of thy ſacred and ſoveraigne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, doe ingenuouſly confeſſe, that we are not worthy to lift up our eyes, or our hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, to call upon thee in our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for our ſinnes are raiſed over our heads like terrible mountaines, which ſeeme to threaten and defie thy judgements, from the top of their
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2870:43"/>preſumptuous impudencie: Iniquity hath made our ſoules as black as firebrands, and the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of thy divine commaundements hath made our conſciences more red then ſcarlet; in a word, forgetting thee, we haue forgotten our ſelues, and remember but as a dreame our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning derived from heaven: Wherefore, O good Ieſus, O ſweet Saviour, of our bodies and ſoules, kindle in our hearts the fire of thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, and let it be a candle to our feete, and a light unto our pathes, that wee may ſafely eſcape out of theſe terrible downefalls, which threaten unto us death and condemnation: waſh our ſoules in the precious blood iſſuing from thy wounds, make them by thy favour whiter then ſnow, and then waſhed wooll; we cannot enter into thy Tabernacle, before wee be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of our faults: graunt then unto us by thy mercy one onely drop of this large, and vaſt ocean of thy great compaſſions; waſh our roabes in the blood of the Lambe, that wee may be made worthy to follow him, whither ſoever he goeth.</p>
               <p>Change our eyes into two lively fountaines of penitent teares, which may become a Iordane of griefe, and diſpleaſure, for having beene ſo wicked before thy face, within the which wee may dip our ſelues ſeaven times, yea ſeaventy times ſeaven times, that we may be delivered of the ſpirituall leproſie of ſinne, which makes us ſo foule and ugly in thy ſight and preſence.</p>
               <p>And after thou haſt pulled off from us the old

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2870:45"/>cruell wounds they can ſcarcely know. On the other ſide, you are frighted by the lamentable complaints, by the loude cries, and pitifull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, of the bewayling widowes, over the dead bodies of their dearely beloved huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: In a word, there is nothing but fire, blood, and ſlaughter to be ſeene, ſo that one may properly ſay, That Warre (the mother of all miſchiefe) is as it were a feaſt celebrated to the honour of death, to whom are continually offered up many pitifull and bloody ſacrifices, which ſhe exactly keepes in the grave.</p>
               <p>But when ſome great Prince of earthly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch undertaketh to agree them, his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors are every where received with open armes, bone fires, and triumphall arches, erected in token of that joy and contentment which they receive, by their mediation for peace, according to that ſaying of the Lord, <hi>Bleſſed are the feete of thoſe that bring tidings of peace,</hi> Rom. 10.16.</p>
               <p>Ieſus Chriſt here continueth his Sermon to his Diſciples, where in a continued order hee ſheweth them the perfection of bleſſedneſſe, he maketh them ſcale the heavens by eight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which they muſt aſcend here on earth.

               <p>Which words by Gods aſſiſtance, wee will divide into two principall parts; 1. the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: 2. the reaſon of it; the propoſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth

               <p>Now for our better underſtanding of theſe words, let us handle them all ſeverally, and let us for a while leave this concrete word <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,</hi> and ſo come to his abſtract, to wit, <hi>peace,</hi> the which is diverſly defined according to the ſeverall ſorts and degrees of it.</p>
               <p>For there is the peace of the body, which is a juſt temperature of the parts.</p>
               <p>There is a peace of the irreaſonable ſoule, which is an inordinate reſt of the appetite.</p>
               <p>The is a peace of the reaſonable ſoule, which is a moderated conſent of the action, and underſtanding.</p>
               <p>There is a peace of the ſoule and body, which is a well governed life, and the health of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature.</p>
               <p>There is a peace of mortall man, which is a well ordered obedience in faith, under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the eternall, and divine law.</p>
               <p>There is a peace of the houſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in a juſt concord of the domeſticall, both in commanding, and obeying.</p>
               <p>There is a peace of the Cite, which is a concord among the Citizens.</p>

               <p>There is a peace of men, which is a mutuall concord. And againe, there is a peace of all

               <p>Where we may note that every word hath his weight, and ineſtimable value.</p>
               <p>For firſt it is a ſucceſſe, and not a hazard, which is happy and not unlucky, of all, and not of ſomething onely, in God, and not in the world.</p>

               <p>The Latines call it <hi>Pax, quaſi pacata,</hi> becauſe it is peaceable, and no way mooved by the windes of ſeditions, nor of deſperate paſſions; Shee is like the Sea when it is calme and quiet, there is nothing fairer to behold, then the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid and ſerene plaines of it, all ſeeming to be an entire piece of Chriſtall.</p>

               <p>Now that wee may the more delight in the deſcription of this garden of peace; let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in imitate theſe Painters, who intending to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto us ſome very excellent beauty, uſe to draw and place cloſe by it ſome black, and ghaſtly picture, that by the oppoſition of that deformity, our eyes may take the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight, in beholding that faire and beautifull face oppoſite to it, according to the truth of the Latine Proverb, <hi>Contraria contrarijs oppoſita mag is eluceſcunt.</hi> One contrary appeareth better by the oppoſition of his contrary: ſo the darkneſſe of the night makes us find the Sunnes light more pleaſant, the thornes embelliſh the

               <p>Now is not this face at the firſt ſight capable to make us abhorre it, even before we perceive the leaſt lineament, or the leaſt draught or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2870:47"/>of beauty, which appeares in the face of his contrary, that is of peace.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee the effects of warre in the hearts where it is praedominant, certainly <hi>ex malo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uo, malum ovum, ex malo ovo, malum omen,</hi> Of an ill Raven, an ill egge, of an ill egge, and ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; for as the Philoſophers ſay, <hi>Qualis cauſa talis effectus,</hi> as is the cauſe, ſo is the effect; Eagles doe not bring forth Doves, nor warre this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and fearefull monſter, any thing elſe but cruelty, rigour, and fierceneſſe.</p>
               <p>When man is poſſeſſed by any of theſe foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh paſſions, (daughters of diſaſter, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of miſfortune) then his reaſon is all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured by it, the uſe of it is loſt, <hi>Denigrata eſt ſuper carbones facies ejus,</hi> The functions of his minde are turned upſide downe, they are like a broken clock, wherein all is in diſorder, and to which there is no truſting: The royall Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſheweth us the effects of it, in few words, <hi>In mine anger</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>mine eye was troubled, my ſoule, and my belly were moved.</hi>

               <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in the 9. <hi>Serm.</hi> on the Lords Supper ſpeaketh thus of it, The peace of this world is in the which whileſt we dwell, we van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh our enemies, wee love one another, and judge not of thoſe things that are hidden from us, that peace which ſhall bee in the world to come, ſhall be when wee ſhall raigne without enemies, where one ſhall not be of contrary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to the other; in a word, where all things ſhall bee knowne, and open to every one, and endeth thus, Ieſus Chriſt is this true peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hath reconciled us to God his Father, by the ineſtimable price of his blood.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the Sermon of the word of the Lord ſpeaketh thus of it, <hi>Pax eſt ſerenitas mentis, tranquillitas animi, ſimplicitas cordis, vincu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum amoris, conſortium charitatis, haec eſt quae ſimul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates tollit, bella compeſcit, iras comprimit, ſuperbos calcat, humiles amat, diſcordes cedat, inimicos con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordat, cunctis eſt placida, neſcit extolli, neſcit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flari, hanc qui acceperit teneat, qui perdiderit repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat, qui amiſerit exquirat, quoniam qui in eadem non erit inventus, a patre abdicatur, a Filio exhaeredatur, à Spiritu Sancto alienus efficitus, nec ad haereditatem

               <p>

               <p>Now we haue heard theſe two pillars of the Church of God; let us hearken to himſelfe, ſpeaking by the mouth of his choſen veſſell, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſs.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which alſo ye are called, in one body, and be ye thankfull.</hi> And <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, keepe your hearts and mindes, through Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that which ſhould moſt bind us to love this <hi>Peace,</hi> is the ſoring or head fountaine from whence it floweth; for as the warre of ſinne proceedeth from the wicked one, ſo the peace of our conſciences commeth from the Father of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2870:50"/>eternity, from the King of mercy; as wee read 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 5.23. <hi>The very God of peace, ſanctifie you wholly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This peace of conſcience is a marke, and an effect of our iuſtification by faith, as wee reade <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Therefore being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe place ſhould induced and incite us to the practiſe of peace, ſince the recompence promiſed to it is ſo excellent; In a word, let us ſhut the gate of peace, with that ſaying of <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi>

               <p>Let us ſay with an ancient Author, that peace is the ſalt of this life, without which it is unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorie, and without reliſh.</p>
               <p>When ſalt is put into the water, it melteth, and inſenſibly becomes liquid, but when it is throwne into the fire, it cracketh, untill it bee quite conſumed; Even ſo is the peacemaker, for he conformeth and faſhioneth himſelfe ſo qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to peace and tranquillity, that hee liveth

               <p>But let us after the example of the high Prieſt, enter into the moſt holy place of the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and there viſite that ſacred arke of our conſciences, within the which God will keepe his ſeſſions: let us contemplate that ineſtimable peace, immediatly proceeding from the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and moſt particular and perfect aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in our ſoules; for it is impoſſible that any other, but the juſt ſhould poſſeſſe that peace of conſcience, ſeeing that betweene ſinne (the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils child, and the father of trouble) and peace, and quietneſſe, there is ſo great an antipathy,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2870:54"/>that if ſinne can ſet the leaſt footing in any place, hee driveth away preſently from thence peace and reſt, and in their roome introduceth and breedeth therein quarrells and contentions, which like tormentors, doe miſerably torture, and cruelly handle the miſerable hearts where they lodge; and therefore the ancient Fathers of the Church openly pronounce, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt felicity wherein <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt modell of mankinde was created, was peace of the heart, that reſt of conſcience, which hee poſſeſſed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely within Paradiſe, having no other care or thought, but to love his Creator, to honour his Conſeruator, and to adore his God.</p>
               <p>But after that hee was fallen from that ſtate of innocencie, by the greatneſſe of his fault, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſinne by diſobedience had driven away peace from his heart, then you ſee him in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he flieth, he hideth himſelfe, he is afraid of himſelfe, he covereth his nakedneſſe with figge leaves, he trembleth, and dareth not anſwere to that terrible and fearefull voyce, which hee heard walking in the Garden, behold the firſt effects which his ſinne brought forth.</p>
               <p>The Royall Prophet <hi>David, Pſalm.</hi> 85.10. ſaith, <hi>Righteouſneſſe and peace have kiſſed each other,</hi> vpon which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> diſcourſeth thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duae ſunt amicae, juſtitia &amp; pax, tu forte unam vis, &amp; alteram non facis, nemo enim eſt quinon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit pacem, ſed non omnes volunt operari juſtitiam, ſi amicam pacis non amaveris, neque te amabit pax ipſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:2870:54"/>Righteouſneſſe and Peace bee two friends, thou it may bee deſireſt the one, and wilt not practiſe the other; there bee none but wiſh for peace, but all will not doe righteouſneſſe; if thou love not the friend of peace, peace alſo will not loue thee.</p>
               <p>Iuſtice with reaſon is called the mother of peace, becauſe it goeth alwayes before, and is immediatly followed by it, <hi>Peace is the worke of juſtice,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> 32.17 And the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the 72. <hi>Pſalm. ver.</hi> 7. <hi>In thoſe dayes righteouſneſſe ſhall flouriſh, and abundance of peace.</hi> And <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119. <hi>ver.</hi> 165. <hi>Great peace have they which love thy law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which propoſitions, wee draw this concluſion, that to have this peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it is needfull for us to be juſt, to feare God, and to walke exactly in the obſeruation of his ſacred commandements.</p>
               <p>So contrarily the wicked can have no peace, becauſe of the worme of ſinne, that gnaweth continually their ſoules, as we read <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 28.3. <hi>Ill lucke and unhappineſſe is in their wayes, and the way of peace have they not knowne. There is no peace for the wicked,</hi> ſaith the Lord; they thinke ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe that they have this peace, when they enjoy their pleaſures; but this peace laſteth but a moment, and like their pleaſure is preſently followed by an extreame griefe, it is lethargick ſleepe, very dangerous; it is a ſecurity, but it is carnall, it is a ſleepe, but that repreſenteth unto them a thouſand apparitions, and a thouſand
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2870:55"/>ſtrange viſions. The wicked mans peace is like thoſe fires which by night appeare burning in hills and medowes, the which if a man follow, they will inſenſibly leade him into terrible downfalls, but the true peace of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as ſaith an ancient Author, is the title of Religion, the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the field of bleſſing, the garden of delights, the Angels joy, the Arke of the covenant, the treaſure of the great King, the Court of God, the Tabernacle of his Sonne, the tent of his Spirit, the tower of <hi>Sion,</hi> the booke with ſeaven ſeales, which is to be opened upon that great and fearefull day of judgement.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (in his Citie of God) ſpeaketh thus of it, <hi>Pax nostra propria, hic eſt, cum Deo per fidem, &amp; in aeternum erit cum illo per ſpeciem, talis eſt paxut ſolatium miſeriae ſit potius quam beatitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis gaudium.</hi> Our owne peace (that is the peace of our hearts) is here with God by faith, and in eternall life ſhall it be with him by viſion: that peace which now we enjoy, is but a ſparke in reſpect of that great fire, here it ſubſiſteth but by faith, then it ſhall be effected.</p>
               <p>In a word let us ſay, that the peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a particular feeling and knowledge that God is pacified with us, that he hath blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out our miſdeedes, that hee hath caſt away our iniquities from before his face, like a clowd, that wee are no longer under the Kingdome of Satan, nor of the fleſh, but are received in our heavenly Fathers favour, like the prodigall
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2870:55"/>child, that wee ſhall dwell in his houſe all the dayes of our life, and there receive thoſe goods, joyes, and delights which he hath reſerued for his children.</p>
               <p>Hitherto wee have ſpoken of peace in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and in particular of politique peace, and of the care muſt bee uſed to bring it to paſſe, of peace of conſcience, or with God, of the worlds, or wicked mans peace, that troubleth all them that live not like him: now, let us ſpeake of that peace which h in our ſelues, and of the vertue of it.</p>
               <p>Among all the perfections wherewith our firſt Father <hi>Adam</hi> was adorned, during the ſtate of his innocencie, mildneſſe was one, at the ſent whereof all living creatures ranne to him, to doe him homape, and yeeld him obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> in the booke of <hi>Numbers,</hi> is called the <hi>debonnaire, or gracious,</hi> for which quality, God loved him dearely, and for a teſtimoniall of his love, called him to that honourable charge of deliverer, Prince and lawgiver of his people.</p>
               <p>The King and Prophet <hi>David</hi> had this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in great meaſure in him, for which cauſe God changing his Sheepheards crooke into a Roy all Scepter, gave him victory over a world of enemies, that roſe up continually againſt him, which maketh him to cry out in one of his Pſalmes, <hi>Lord remember David and his manſuetude or clemencie.</hi> In the booke of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> God commandeth the Prieſts to offer him a Lambe without blemiſh for a peace offering; a Lambe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2870:56"/>is the ſymbole of mildneſſe, then according to that command, hee that will receive the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers recompense from God, muſt offer him his ſoule full of gentleneſſe and mildneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Lambe in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of all living creatures, was onely found worthy to open the booke ſealed with ſeaven ſeales; ſo among all men the faithfull onely, and among the faithfull the meeke, ſhall bee able to open the booke of life, there to behold his name written before the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>The Bridegroome in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> calleth thus his beloved, <hi>Come my Dove, that art in the clefts of the rocke, thy eyes are like Doves eyes, and thy checkes like Turtles, my Dove is alone, and perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is familiar and common enough, that of all creatures Doves are the ſymbols of mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and meekeneſſe, for it is noted that they have no gall. And here to apply theſe places to our deſigne, let us know that the Bridegroome in this <hi>epithalamium</hi> or marriage ſong, is Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, ſpeaking to his Church, ſetting her forth by her lively colours, by the penſill of his love, ſhewing us in this compariſon of the Dove, the perfections wherewith ſhee is adorned, where if wee waigh and conſider dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently the force of every word, wee ſhall finde them all emphaticall, and deſeruing a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſearch and obſeruation.</p>
               <p>He ſaith firſt <hi>Veni Columba mea,</hi> come my Dove, hee doth not call her my Eagle or my
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2870:56"/>Hawke, for thoſe are creatures too cruell, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing but blood, and ſlaughter, and their humour is incompatible with the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groomes bounty, who deſireth that the Church (his well beloved Spouſe) bee altogether like him, and therefore he calleth her my Dove, as having no gall, nor bitterneſſe in her ſoule.</p>
               <p>When that ſweet IESVS was baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Iordane,</hi> the three divine perſons of the glorious Trinity were clearely manifeſted, for the majeſtuous voyce of the Father was heard ſpeaking from heaven thus, <hi>This is my well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Mathew 3.17.</p>
               <p>Ieſus Chriſt was in <hi>Iordane,</hi> and the holy Ghoſt deſcended from heaven like a Dove, and lighted upon him, from which place wee may draw this inſtruction, that if wee deſire to bee called the children of God, if we wiſh to heare from heaven that gracious voyce, ſpeaking to our ſoules, <hi>Thou art my well beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If wee aſpire to that great happineſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſpirit of grace, mildneſſe, and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our conſciences.</p>
               <p>Let us remember that wee muſt be like unto ſweet IESVS our example, hee was naked, ſo muſt we put off cruelty, malice, and hatred: he was in the water, even ſo to enjoy ſo great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, we muſt plunge our ſelues in the rivers of our teares, in the Iordane of a holy and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which may open our hearts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2870:57"/>touch them with griefe, for our fore-paſt offences.</p>
               <p>It was Gods ordinance under the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that when a man was uncleane, hee ſhould for his purification reſort to the Temple, and there offer two Turtle Doves.</p>
               <p>That we may light the torch of truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſhadow of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, let us ſay, that there is nothing that more infecteth and ſoyleth the ſoule, then cruelty, debates, and hatred; It is a Gangrene that gnaweth and undermineth her, untill it ſeeth her abſolutely poſſeſſed by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſpirits; but the onely remedy to this obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate diſeaſe, is, to runne to the ſacred Temple of Gods divine mercy, there to offer him the gift of a mild, meeke, and peaceable conſcience.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Noah</hi> would know if the waters were withdrawne from upon the face of the earth, he ſent forth a Dove, which came to him in the evening with an Olive branch in her mouth; alſo he ſent forth a Raven, which returned not, becauſe hee ſtayd on the dead bodies, and ſtinking carcaſſes of thoſe which died in this inundation.</p>
               <p>God (in this example) is repreſented unto us by <hi>Noah,</hi> our ſoule by the Dove, peace by the Olive branch, it is God that ſtaying in the Arke of heaven, ſendeth our ſoules to viſite the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations of this world, which meſſage faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to performe, they do not ſit on the higheſt and loftieſt tops of Cedars, arid Pine trees, for they love not vanity, nor the glory of this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2870:57"/>world, they doe not pearch upon the Iuniper, nor thornes of quarrels and contentions, but upon the Olive tree of mildneſſe, and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherewith they adorne themſelues, and ſo prepare themſelues to returne into their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Country, there to give a true account of their journey.</p>
               <p>But the Ravens that ſtayed upon the carcaſſes drowned by the flood, are thoſe blacke and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſoules, that delight in nothing but quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and contentions, and who ſo exceſſively love the corruptions of this world, that they never returne to heaven, from whence they tooke their firſt flight.</p>
               <p>The excellencie of this particular peace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſufficiently knowne, without we conſider the privation of it, that is contemplate her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; let us judge it by our ſelues, for there is no man that ſinneth not, there is nothing more extrauagant in the world then a ſeared conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nothing more toſſed up and downe then a ſoule troubled and vexed by the unquietneſſe of ſinne, for example doe wee ſeeke the meanes to revenge ſome injurie? preſently our minde runneth and rangeth all about, to obtaine a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſatisfaction, Our eyes dart and caſt forth burning flames of wrath, and rage; our mouth proffereth nothing but injuries, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; our feete cannot ſtand ſtill; our hands itch; our hearts vomit revenge, and our braines are ſo preoccupated by this damnable paſſion, that there is nothing but confuſion to be ſeene,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2870:58"/>as in a clocke out of order, whoſe wheeles are diſmounted; theſe be the effects of ſinne, that never gives reſt to ſoule, never ſo little touched by the venome of his paſſion.</p>
               <p>Conſider I pray, a malefactor how bold and ſecret ſoever his crime be, hee thinks neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that all know it, the leaſt looke altereth his face, and for his contenance, If hee thinke that to keepe off be good for him, when he is in the fields, he thinketh every buſh a Sergeant, to lay hold on him, every tree a Hangman, that ſtayes for him, and every leafe that ſtirreth, a witneſſe to teſtifie his wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Now contrariwiſe, let us ſee the ſweet reſt and tranquillity of a ſoule that hath made her peace with her God, whom ſhee loves with all her ſtrength, and that cheriſheth her neighbour as much as her ſelfe, who is not puffed up with the winde of ambition, and that is not infected with covetouſneſſe, who laugheth at wrongs, and careth not for revenge, who goeth boldly every where, and feareth nothing, for he that is deepely in Gods favour, ſhould be afraid of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; in a word, a quiet and peaceable ſoule ſtudieth and buſieth her ſelfe about nothing, but to love, ſerue, and honour her God, ſhee is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes betweene love and feare, love to pleaſe him, feare of offending him, a feare, I ſay filiall, but not ſeruile.</p>
               <p>When I thinke upon this peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the minde and ſoule, I am like the needle of a Compaſſe, that alwayes turnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2870:58"/>the North of my deſires, towards my Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, my Saviour, and my God; which is the excellenteſt and perfecteſt patterne of peace and mildneſſe that I am able to chuſe, or propoſe in this behalfe and matter: <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) <hi>the meeke Lambe, he is brought as a Lambe to the ſlaughter, and as a dumbe Sheepe before her ſhearers, and hee opened not his mouth,</hi> Iſaiah 53.7.</p>
               <p>It is a thing very frequently, and commonly knowne, that the Panther ſmelleth ſo ſweet, that all other beaſts come to ſmell to her: Our ſweet Ieſus is repreſented by her, both by her name and effects, for in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth all, as God was defined by <hi>Plato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ieſus Chriſt breathes forth ſo ſweet and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant a ſmell, that it embalmeth the faithfulls ſoules, ſo ſpeaketh the Spouſe in the Canticles, <hi>The name of my beloved is like oyle ſhed, therefore have the young maydens loved thee ſo dearely:</hi> by theſe maydens wee muſt underſtand the virgins of ſinne, thoſe that have not knowne iniquity, that love peace, and ſeeke after it; after hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on, <hi>Chap</hi> 4.11. <hi>Thy lips, O my Spouſe! drop as the hony combe: hony and milke are under thy tongue, and the ſmell of thy garments is like the ſmell of Lebanon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee ſhould paſſe too often over the ſame ſteps and path, if we ſhould here againe ſpeake of the admirable and inimitable mildneſſe, and tranquillity of our good Maſter and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe birth preacheth unto us
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2870:59"/>humility, his life peace, and his death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
               <p>Let us then ſtrive to imitate him as much as wee can poſſible, in our youth, being very humble: in our viril age, peaceable, and in our old age pitifull; and in all the courſe of our life milde, bountifull, and loving, following <hi>Davids</hi> counſell, <hi>Love peace and ſeeke it, for God with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable and gracious eye, beholds him that is ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious of peace, and he heareth his moſt humble pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the time of his affliction, Pſalm.</hi> 34.16. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold great and divine profits, faire and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rewards and recompences, that the faithfull get, by ſeeking after peace with God, and by having procured all the meanes of agreement with their neighbours, both in things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them, and in things needfull to the union and concord of all our brethren.</p>
               <p>Let us now heare that gracious and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable voyce, ſhewing unto us the profit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence which wee muſt without doubt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, for having beene peacemakers, it is Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, who is not a man, that hee ſhould lye, nor the Sonne of man, that he ſhould repent, when he ſaith in our text,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the peacemakers: for they ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the children of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He doth not onely ſay they ſhall be bleſſed, after their death, but they are ſo already, becauſe that he makes them know in their ſoules, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light he takes in it, and the goods which they ſhall receive, which is eternall peace, <hi>Bleſſed then
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2870:59"/>are the feete of thoſe that bring tidings of peace,</hi> Iſaiah 52.7.</p>
               <p>This particle, <hi>For,</hi> ſheweth the reaſon of their bleſſedneſſe, and not the cauſe, for if all the peacemakers were the children of God, by conſequence many Turkes and Pagans ſhould be ſuch, becauſe they are peacemakers.</p>
               <p>But the tree muſt be firſt good, before it can beare good fruit, ſo wee muſt firſt be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, before wee can be true peacema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, for thoſe that are peacemakers not being the children of God, have already received their reward, that is, they have received the praiſe and applauſe of the world, which they were peacemakers to obtaine, but all that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a maske and falſe apparition of that true peace, which God recommendeth unto us.</p>
               <p>In this reaſon of Chriſts, why the peacema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers ſhall be called the children of God, wee muſt note and obſerue a double Hebraiſme, the one in the word <hi>Children,</hi> the other in the verbe, they ſhall be called, <hi>vocabuntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Hebraiſme is in the word <hi>Filij, Children,</hi> which in the holy tongue ſignifieth <hi>conformee,</hi> and <hi>like,</hi> as <hi>Math.</hi> 5.44.45. <hi>Love your enemies, bleſſe them that curſe you, doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you, that ye may be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that is like to your Father which is in heaven.</hi>

And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.12. <hi>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name, thoſe that thou gaveſt me I have kept, and none of them is loſt, but the Sonne of perdition,</hi> that is, <hi>he that was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to deſtruction:</hi> but this kind of ſpeech touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not our text.</p>
               <p>But let us ſay that this word <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> is comonly attributed in Scripture either to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and being the naturall Sonne of God, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Father and the Sonne <hi>ſunt relata,</hi> ſay the Philoſophers, are relatives, that is, are referred the one to the other; for there is no Father, but there muſt likewiſe be a Sonne, whence I draw this concluſion, That God the Father being ſuch, that is, having that title and quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Creation of the world, conſequently Ieſus Chriſt was before it, alſo his generation then is immediatly from the Father, as being begotten of him from all eternity, by a way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible to us; for, <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God, the ſame was in the beginning with God, Iohn</hi> 1.1.

                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:2870:61"/>Hee is not then called Sonne by adoption, or for reſpects of love, or for any conſideration, but onely becauſe hee is begotten of the Father before the Creation of all things, as wee reade <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.15. <hi>He is the Image of the inuiſible God, the firſt borne of every creature:</hi> which is prooved againe out of the 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> of Saint <hi>Iohn, ver.</hi> 18. <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time, the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne which is in the boſome of the Father, hee hath declared him.</hi>

               <p>And Saint <hi>Chryſostome</hi> very ſubtilly, <hi>Chriſtum non eodem modo quo caeteri homines unigenitum dici, nam caeteros quidem quod ſoli ex parentibus nati ſint unigenitos dici, Chriſtum non ſolum quod ſolus ex patre, ſed etiam quod ſingulari &amp; ineffabili modo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt unigenitum appellari.</hi> Chriſt is not called the onely Sonne after the ſort of other men, who are called ſuch, becauſe they are borne alone to their Parents; now Chriſt is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the onely Sonne in that reſpect alone, that he is the onely naturall Sonne of his Father, but alſo becauſe he hath beene begotten by a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ineffable way.</p>
               <p>But whither doth the winde of our diſcourſe carrie us, why doe we touch this divine ſubject, more worthy of admiration then capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; wee ſhall more lively deſcribe it by
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2870:62"/>our ſilence, then by our obſcure repreſentations. Nevertheleſſe for ſatisfaction to our curioſity, which is never contented with reaſon, and that will not be contained within the limits of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and modeſty; let us bring one onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, to give us ſome ſparke of knowledge of this ineffable generation of the Sonne of God. When a man ſeeth himſelfe in a well poliſhed glaſſe, he preſently ſeeth his image, and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of himſelfe, having the ſame markes, and motions with his, which is cauſed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the ſpecies within the eye, and there is ſo great a relation betweene the ſpecies, and the image, that one cannot be taken away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out annihilating the other; and although both the ſight and reaſon make us ſee, that they are ſeverall things, truth alſo and experience makes us know that thoſe two things ſubſiſt by one onely Eſſence, and that both have but one and the ſame ſubſiſtance, to wit, that of the ſpecies oppoſite to the glaſſe.</p>
               <p>So God from all Eternity, contemplating his divine Eſſence, made ſuch a reflection upon his perſon; that of this reflection hee produced and begot that eternall Wiſedome, which is the Saviour and Redeemer of our ſoules; the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we can goe from this matter is our beſt, for wee ſhould be like them that will paint and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Sunne with a coale.</p>
               <p>And indeede how ſhould it be poſſible, that we that are poore Owles and Batts, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſo great a light; how ſhould wee that are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2870:62"/>poore Piſmires ſtirre ſo great mountaines?

               <p>Since then, that we cannot aſcend ſo high, let us ſtop and ſtay our contemplation upon our ſelues, where we ſhall have a more free acceſſe; and continuing our firſt diſcourſe, let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that we may be called the children of God three wayes, 1.

               <p>There is a filiation, or (not to ſpeake barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly with the Schoolemen) the Scripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this title of <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> to the Angels and Princes of the earth, which is a title of honour and affection, as wee read <hi>Iob</hi> 1.6. <hi>Now there was a day when the ſonnes of God</hi> (that is the Angels) <hi>came to preſent themſelues before the Lord, and Satan came alſo among them.</hi> And <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6.4. <hi>When the ſonnes of God came in unto the daughters of men;</hi> The ſeaventy Interpreters by the ſonnes of God here underſtand the Angels: but Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the Citie of God by the ſonnes of God; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the children of <hi>Seth,</hi> which was a bleſſed family, which came in unto the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>And <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31.9. <hi>I will cauſe them to walke by the rivers of waters in a ſtraight way, wherein they ſhall not ſtumble, for I am a Father to Iſrael, and Ephraim is my firſt borne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third ſort of the children of God, is of them that are ſuch by adoption and by grace, as we reade <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>God hath predeſtinated us unto the adoption of children, by Ieſus Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> And <hi>Galath.</hi> 4.5. <hi>God ſent forth his Sonne made of a woman, that wee might receive the adoption of ſonnes.</hi> And <hi>Iames</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his owne will begate hee us, with the word of trueth; that we ſhould be a kinde of first fruits of his creatures.</hi>

                  </gap> filiation or adoption, but that wee may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that when our firſt Father <hi>Adam</hi> fell from the ſtate of grace in which he was created, hee became the enemie of God, for ſinne by his gluttonie having ſeaſed the dungeon of his ſoule, inciteth and provoketh him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2870:64"/>to warre againſt God by diſobedience to his divine commaundements, and by the ſame ſinne he made God his enemie, ſo that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging juſtice inſtantly tooke from him that faire Robe of Iuſtice, holineſſe, and innocencie, in which he was created.</p>
               <p>But his mercie being not able to ſuffer that man, that maiſter-piece of his hands, ſhould be for ever baniſhed &amp; confined within the paines and torments of hell, to ſatisfie his Iuſtice, hath left ſome in their Reprobation, to endure and ſuffer the puniſhment due to their faults, and hath choſen and elected ſome to teſtifie in them the effect of his compaſſions, breaking the chaines wherewith Satan kept them bound, and that by ſending into the world his onely and well beloved Sonne, who hath paid their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome by the ineſtimable price of his pretious blood; and moreover, having given them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, hee hath beſides beſtowed on them the gift to be made the children of God, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires with his Sonne of eternall and moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed life: And thus it is, that wee are called the children of God in our text, children by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by favour and by grace. This cuſtome of adopting is common and familiar among men, for we ſee many that having caſt their affection upon ſtrange children, receive them into their houſes, love them dearely, bring them up with great care, and at their lifes end appoint unto them either all, or part of their beſt inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:2870:64"/>Let us now draw ſome inſtructions from all this diſcourſe, and let us ſay, That ſince God hath ſo much honoured us, as to adopt us for his children, that we muſt not beare unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that title, to the end that we may receive the effect of his invariable promiſes, to wit, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of heaven, and life eternall.</p>

               <p>And after we have quenched and put out the trouble of our hearts, &amp; vexation of our ſoules, cauſed by the fire of ſinne, when wee ſhall have ſcattered thoſe flames that deſtroy and devoure that union and concord, which God hath ſo ſtrictly commanded us to keepe, then ſhall wee be called to that heavenly <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which is the Citie of peace, and there ſhall wee enter into the poſſeſſion of the inheritance promiſed to adopted children in Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, wee ſhall partake with him eternall bleſſedneſſe, hee ſhall be our head, in thoſe divine ſeſſions, and we ſhall be his members, wee ſhall ſhine as the Sun, the holy Ghoſt ſhall enlighten us, and the God of peace ſhall be for ever with us. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>We can offer up no ſacrifice ſo pleaſing, nor performe no action or duty ſo acceptable to God, as when wee adore him in all feare, and reverence him in all aſtoniſhment &amp; trembling, which lively depaynteth and prefigureth his Greatneſſe and Magnificence, perfectly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrateth us our Duties, and witneſſeth our humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and obedience, which is exceeding delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and pleaſing to him.</p>
               <p>That Romane Emperour perſpicuouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and deciphered the excellent power and effects of this feare, when he caried for his Motto and Deviſe, <hi>Oderint dum metuant,</hi> Let thoſe hate me that will, ſo they feare me; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby what ſmall account and eſteeme hee made of the hatred, and how dearely he priſed and reſpected the feare which hee would have given and borne to him.</p>
               <p>Morall Philoſophers affirme and ſay, That Love and feare are two fiſter germanes, becauſe the one is conjoyned to the other, and both
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2870:67"/>linked together produce one &amp; the ſame effects; for ſtill the Lover is in care and feare of the thing beloved; whereas wee never feare to loſe that which wee hate, but that Which wee love dearely, and cheriſh tenderly, and both of theſe together produce the conſeruation of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But this diſtinction takes no place, but here on earth among creatures, and doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regard nor looke up towards Heaven to God the Creator; For God is all Love, but he can never be capable of alteration or defect, as is that feare which he hath left and given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man for his portion and inheritance.</p>
               <p>So he which is poſſeſſed with a perfect feare, to offend his God, or to loſe his favour, he is linked and joyned to God with the Gordian knots of his love, which are then wholly made indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inſeparable; and the Love of God conjoyned with the feare of man, cauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the ſoule; and this it is, where the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us in our text, <hi>Feare God,</hi> By which word <hi>feare</hi> wee muſt not underſtand, a cowardize, a puſillanimity, or any irregular paſſion, which freezeth our blood in our veines, which cauſeth our hearts to pant and beat with an inceſſant motion, which calls and attracts our blood from all parts of our bodies; to come to aſſiſt and ſuccour our heart, which ſhutts and hoodwinkes our eyes againſt reaſon; and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth, that all objects whatſoever preſented to us, have all together conjured and conſpired our ruine; as thoſe who fly from a battaile, feare
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2870:68"/>every buſh which they ſee or meete with to be their enemies, who purpoſely purſue them, and runne every where to kill them: Or elſe as thoſe who are led to their executions and deathes, whom feare doth ſo powerfully ſeize and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, that by theſe paſſions and effects, it in a manner deprives them of life, before they think thereof, the which wee can teſtifie and approve by many irrevocable precedents and examples.</p>
               <p>No, no: It is not of this defect of judgement, or of this cowardly apprehenſion and feare, which our Apoſtle tells us of; but it a holy, juſt, and commendable feare, which we ought to have and retaine, in bearing an admirable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and honour to the Creator and conſeruer of our bodies and ſoules; As to feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before the terrible throne of his divine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and by not raſhly abuſing of his favours and mercies, ſo liberally, ſo bountifully exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us, becauſe his preſence is a conſuming fire, which devoures and conſumes to aſhes, all thoſe who unreverently approach his ſacred Throne, his moſt holy hill; as heretofore hee forbad the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not to approach mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> becauſe hee was there purpoſely to ſpeake with his ſervant <hi>Moſes:</hi> But not to ſtay any longer on this point, let us ſay with the Philoſophers and Theologians, that there is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally two ſorts of feare (that is to ſay) Divine and Humane, which againe ſubdivide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues every one into three ſeverall parts and branches;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:2870:68"/>The Humane feare compriſeth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Naturall, which hath wholly buried in her, the ſenſes, all Philoſophy, and the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt aſſured courage cannot hinder him from ſhutting his eyes at the ſuddaine ſurpriſe of a flaſh of lightning, or at the feignedneſſe of a hand, which unexpectedly approacheth our face; or that we withdraw not, or turne not our head from the ſight of a fearefull precipice; or that a ſuddaine crack or noyſe doe not at firſt hearing terrifie or aſtoniſh us:</p>
               <q>Primi illi motus non ſunt hominis,</q>
               <p>The firſt motions (or terrours) are not in our power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Corporall, whereby wee naturally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre Death, and feare to expoſe and caſt our ſelues into danger.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mundane, (or worldly) whereby we feare to loſe our wealth, honours, and dignities, but it is of neither of theſe ſorts of feares, which our Apoſtle ſpeakes unto us, but ondy of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine feare,</hi> which likewiſe ſtreames foorth in three rivolets:
<list>
                     <item>1. Servile; whereby we feare God, for the apprehenſion we have of the infernall tortures and torments of Hell, and this degree and ſort of feare is not good of it ſelfe, becauſe it hath no good object, nor is made or formed to a good end; nevertheleſſe, it is held and termed good, becauſe it conduceth to good.</item>
                     <item>2. Initiant, which lookes two wayes: 1. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2870:69"/>the torments wee feare: 2. towards the glory we deſire, and it is alſo termed, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven, or mixt, becauſe it is compoſed both of a good and bad feare.</item>
                     <item>3. Filiall, which is the laſt and beſt ſort of divine feare, whereby we love God not only for our owne glory, or for the apprehenſion of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but for his goodnes, excellency, perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in a word, for and in regard of himſelfe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> lively deſcribes, and pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſents thoſe three ſorts of feare: 1. <hi>Ne cruciemur à gehenna:</hi> 2. <hi>Ne excluſi à viſione tam ineſtimabili gloria privemur:</hi> 3. <hi>Replet animum ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitudine ne deſeratur à gratia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which is to ſay: The firſt feare apprehends torments; The ſecond, the privation of glory; and the third wholly poſſeſſeth our hearts and mindes with care and anxiety, as fearing not to loſe Gods grace and favour.</p>
               <p>The ſervile feare is attributed to the wicked.</p>
               <p>The filiall, to the good, I meane to thoſe who are the children of God.</p>
               <p>The Initiant (or intermixed) is proper as well to the good, as the bad, and alſo it is the moſt frequent and generall.</p>
               <p>Thoſe three ſorts of feare are ſo many wings, which conduct, elevate, &amp; ſoare us up to heaven; The Servile begins firſt, which denounceth to ſinners eternall death and damnation, and that ſharpe and ſenſible apprehenſion to be devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the flames of hell fire. It opens him the gate to be ſorrowfull for his offences, which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2870:69"/>threaten to precipitate him in that unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire, and afterwards entering into a firme and lively repentance for his former ſinnes, hee begins to conceive the future felicity and glory of Heaven, for the love whereof hee partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolues to forſake and abandon ſinne: as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>By the feare of the Lord men depart from evill, Prov</hi> 16.6. Although nevertheleſſe that he doe it, partly for feare of puniſhment which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly follow him; and af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er that, it againe leades him into this perfect filiall feare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſo infinitely loves God, that hee had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye, then offend him in the leaſt thing of the world; ſo neerely he loves him, ſo deerely he honoureth and adores him.</p>
               <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes onely two ſorts of feare, (to wit) <hi>Filiall,</hi> and <hi>Servile,</hi> and makes them dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in this, That the <hi>Servile</hi> hath for object <hi>malum poenae,</hi> the evill of puniſhment, and the filiall <hi>malum culpae,</hi> the evill of guiltineſſe; <hi>Illo timetur ne incidatur in tormentum ſupplicij, iſto ne amittatur gratia beneficij:</hi> By the firſt, wee feare the torments of hell fire; By the ſecond, wee feare to loſe the grace and favour of God.</p>
               <p>It is this faire, this ſweet ſpirituall vertue, which gives us admittance and entrance into the cloſet of God; which openeth unto us the treaſures of his favour and mercy, and which makes us enter into the poſſeſſion of life eternall; <hi>For thoſe who feare the Lord ſhall behold his face, ſhall have proſperity, and ſee good dayes,</hi> ſaith the royall Prophet King <hi>David, Pſalm.</hi> 34.11. It is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2870:70"/>this feare of the Lord, which makes men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper on earth, as ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> the Prince of wiſe men, and the wiſeſt of Princes, <hi>The feare of the Lord prolongeth dayes, but the yeares of the wicked ſhall be ſhortned, Prov.</hi> 10.27. This wiſe King, in all his afflictions and troubles, had ſtill his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the feare of the Lord, which was his fortreſſe, his Sanctuary, his comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, as wee ſhall read in the 14. Chap. of <hi>Proverbs, In the feare of the Lord is ſtrong confidence, and his children ſhall have a place of refuge, The feare of the Lord is a fountaine of life to depart from the ſnares of death:</hi> He againe teacheth us, that wealth is unprofitable, yea prejudiciall to us without this ſalubrious, this ſacred feare of God, &amp; that poverty is to be preferred before fading and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable riches: <hi>Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treaſure and trouble therewith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This feare of the Lord, is (as it were) <hi>Iacobs</hi> Ladder, whereby the Angels (of divine conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations) deſcend upon us on earth, and our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayers, and religious thoughts and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aſcend unto Heaven. This Ladder hath three principall ſteps; <hi>As the feare of the Lord makes us aſcend unto Ieſus Christ, which is our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for through and by God he hath made us wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Ieſus Chriſt leades us to God his Father, and God receives and lodgeth us in Heaven, and therefore we firſt feare him, if ever we hope or thinke to enter into his favour.</p>
               <p>This feare of God, is the head ſpring and fountaine, from whence wee draw and exhauſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2870:70"/>the ſacred myſteries of our ſalvation; and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> tells us in formall and expreſſe termes, <hi>That the feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſedome, Pſal.</hi> 111.10. Thereby to teach us, that all this knowledge and learning whereof men vaunt and glory, is nothing elſe but pure folly, if it derive not his Origen, or beginning from the feare of the Lord. This feare is here taken for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of wiſedome, and Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe (in many places of Scripture) hath aſſumed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the title of <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> becauſe he is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Father, as wee reade in the former alledged Chapter of 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. But in the book of <hi>Geneſ. Chap.</hi> 31.42. He himſelfe is by <hi>Moſes</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the feare of Iſaac; Except the God of my Father, the God of Abraham, and the feare of Iſaac had beene with me, thou hadst ſent me away empty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here the beſt Interpreters, by this <hi>feare of Iſaac,</hi> doe underſtand the ſecond perſon of the Trinity, Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour, who had not yet aſſumed and cloathed our humane nature, and of whom <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the true type and figure, It is an excellent queſtion of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (in his Citie of God) that is, If this filiall feare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the faithfull Children of the Lord remaine with them in Heaven yea or no: Thoſe who maintaine the contrary, fortifie themſelues from the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iohn, Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>There is no feare in love, but perfect love caſteth out feare, becauſe feare hath torment, and hee that feareth is not made perfect in love,</hi> from whence they argue,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:2870:71"/>Where there is perfect Love, there is no feare.</p>
               <p>But among the Saints in Heaven there is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love.</p>
               <p>Therefore among the Saints in Heaven there is no feare.</p>
               <p>And from the ſame place and paſſage of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> they derive and draw another Argument thus:</p>
               <p>All feare is accompanied with torment.</p>
               <p>But in Heaven there is no torment.</p>
               <p>Therefore in Heaven there is no feare.</p>
               <p>They ſay (moreover) That this feare ſhould then deprive them of their reſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and conſequently that they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a perfect felicity, whiles they were troubled and tormented with any apprehenſion or feare. Others anſwere, That the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> underſtands not to ſpeake there of a chaſt and filiall, but of a ſervile feare, and to fortifie and ſupport their opinion they alledge, the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.9. <hi>The feare of the Lord is cleane, enduring for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> expounding this ſort of feare, ſaith, <hi>Non enim eſt timor exterrens à malo quod accidere poteſt, ſed tenens in bono, quod amitti non poteſt;</hi> This kinde of feare makes us not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend any evill which can befall us, but makes us ſo to keepe faſt good, that wee may not loſe it; And afterwards he againe addeth, <hi>Timoris Caſti nomine, ea voluntas, ſignificata eſt, quo nos ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe erit nolle Peceare, non ſolicitudine neceſsitatis, ſed tranquillitate charitatis,</hi> He ſayes, that by this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2870:71"/>name of chaſt feare, is ſignified, the will where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is neceſſary, that we will not ſinne, not for the care of neceſſity, but for the tranquillity of Charity. Hee then concludes, that indeed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile feare cannot enter into Heaven but onely the filiall, and yet (notwithſtanding) it muſt be after it hath loſt the effects which it produceth in this preſent life, (to wit) this naturall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, whereby ſhee feares that the ſoule falls from the State of Grace: No, no, this feare in Heaven ſhall be but a perfect reverence, honour, and piety, and a full and abſolute devotion, which wee ſhall beare to the ſervice of GOD; whereby every one ſeeing the divine Majeſtie, ſhall profoundly and perfectly ſtudy to ſerue and honour him in all reverence: And for this cauſe it is why the 70. Interpreters have turned <hi>Timorem Dei,</hi> the feare of God, into this Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (to wit) <hi>Dei pietatem,</hi> the piety which we beare to God, and ſo it remaines true, which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> had ſaid long before, <hi>The feare of the Lord is cleane enduring for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Elementary world, the feare of God is the moſt aſſured way to goe to celeſtiall <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> Thoſe who have not beene to a place, if they fooliſhly &amp; raſhly runne athwart fields, they then runne a great hazard to goe aſtray, and to loſe themſelues among woods or bryars, or peradventure to fall into the hands of cruell and mercileſſe theeves: So thoſe who will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the top of the holy Mountaine of ſacred <hi>Sion;</hi> If they are not curbed and retained by the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2870:72"/>golden bridle of the feare of God; If without wiſedome or judgement they runne over crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie rockes full of thornes and bryars (for ſuch are the wayes to <hi>Sion</hi> &amp; Heaven) without doubt they will fall into the errour of precipices, or elſe they will ſerve for prey, or fewell to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall flames.</p>
               <p>The feare of God, is the pledge and ſeale of his love and favour, the which hee placeth and planteth in the midſt of our hearts, when he will call us to him, and conſerue us to his ſervice; For he hath united and tyed us to him with the linkes and chaynes of his love in his owne houſe; Hee for ever makes us his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſervants, yea, his heires and adoptive chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and in this quality hee makes vs to enter into the inheritance of eternall life above in Heaven with Ieſus Chriſt his only welbeloved Sonne, who is our eldeſt Brother; Neither are they phantaſtick imaginations, or light pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, which muſt make us beleeve theſe things, for it is God himſelfe which hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them by his Prophet <hi>Ieremy, Chap.</hi> 22.39.40. <hi>I will give them one heart and one way, that they may feare me for ever, and I will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant with them, that I will not turne away from them to doe them good, but I will put my feare into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The feare of the Lord takes place among the rareſt preſents, and richeſt Iewels which the Holy Ghoſt diſcovereth to his Elect, and it is the entry to the greateſt, which is wiſedome it
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2870:72"/>ſelfe; for as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith truth, <hi>The beginning of wiſedome is the feare of God:</hi> For when the Holy Ghoſt will operate in the heart of any man, hee then ſtampes and markes him with his ſeale, which is the feare of God, and then conducts him by degrees unto the very laſt point of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which is wiſdome, or the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſacred myſteries, as wee read in the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, Chap.</hi> 11.2. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſedome and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the ſpirit of counſell and might, the ſpirit of knowledge, and the feare of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The old proverbe ſaith truly, That feare and diffidence is the mother of ſecurity, for when we feare our enemie, and are vigilant over his actions, then we prevent his ambuſhes, &amp; avoyd his power. Let us remember that Sathan (the deadly enemie of our ſoules) watcheth ſtill at the doore of our hearts, as a roaring Lyon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to devoure his prey, ſo that if wee have not ſtill the feare of God before our eyes, to avoyd the nets and ginnes which he layes in the way for us, we ſhall become his prey and food. But if wee ſtand upon our guards, and no way feare his aſſaults or threatnings; then hee will infallibly fly from us both with haſt and ſhame; For God commonly beſtoweth his graces and favours, to thoſe who feare to offend him, and hee diſtributeth and imparteth his richeſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to thoſe that ſerve him with reverence, feare, and trembling: Wee reade <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>That when the day of Pentecoſt was fully come, they were
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2870:73"/>all with one accord in one place, and ſuddenly there came a ſound from heaven as of a ruſhing mighty winde, and it filled all the houſe where they were ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it ſate upon each of them, and they were all filled with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Firſt this great noyſe, this impetuous winde, which ſhaked all the houſe at the comming of the holy Ghoſt, ſerves to teach us, that thoſe who feare God, and who tremble under the authority of his all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull hand, are thoſe whom he viſiteth by his holy Ghoſt, and whom hee repleniſheth with his benefits and graces, as he did here his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. We read in Saint <hi>Iohn Chap.</hi> 20.19. <hi>When the doores were ſhut where the Diſciples were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for feare of the Iewes, that Ieſus came and ſtood in the middes of them, and ſayd, Peace be unto you:</hi> And what is this but a leſſon to teach us, that the children of God ſhould keepe their hearts cloſe, and faſt ſhut for feare of vices, ſinnes, and offences; whereunto the devill (denoted by the Iewes) doth every day by a thouſand ſnares and artifices, ſeeke to ſeduce and draw our ſoules to eternall death: Thoſe people, I ſay, when they were ſhut up for feare, then God came and viſited them, and gave them his peace as he did to his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> receiving the tables of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinay, Exod.</hi> 19.16. So many ſtormes, ſo many claps of thunder, and flaſhes of lightning fearefully fell upon the heads of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they were all aſtoniſhed with horrour
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2870:73"/>and trembling: But they were preſently exempt and freed from this feare, when <hi>Moſes</hi> brought them the contract of their alliance, written with the proper hand of God; ſo when wee excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly feare and reverence God, then ſpeedily he makes a firme friendſhip and alliance with our ſoules.</p>
               <p>Whiles the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had the feare of God before their eyes, they were fraughted and repleniſhed with a thouſand bleſſings; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from a thouſand misfortunes; by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miracles they were preſerved from bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſlavery, by a thouſand prodigies they paſt thorow the red Sea, drew water out of Rockes, and were fed in the wilderneſſe with Manna and Quayles from heaven. But as ſoone as (by their impious and treacherous Idolatry) they had caſt off the yoke of the ſweet and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious feare of God, and ſhut their eyes againſt the judgements of the ever living God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly after they had adored the golden Calfe, then God ſent flying Serpents who ſlew them by thou ſands, which ſheweth and teacheth us, That thoſe who walk uprightly in the pathes of Gods commandements, and are marked with the ſeale of awfull feare, are ſtill filled with his bleſſings and benefits; but the perverſe and obſtinate, who caſt away the ſnaffle, they I ſay, ſtumble at a thouſand miſeries and misfortunes, and being forſaken and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned of GOD, they are expoſed and precipitated to eternall death, and given in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2870:74"/>prey to that olde Serpent the devill.</p>
               <p>The auncient Pagans have perfectly and truly depaynted feare, when they ſaid it was all environed with fire and flames, as Love; and ſo they underſtood of corporall and Mundane (or worldly feare) and likewiſe of divine feare, concerning their falſe imaginary Gods. Here we will doe as <hi>Noah</hi> did; Wee will make uſe of ſinners to build the Arke of our ſalvation, or as <hi>Salomon</hi> did of the timber &amp; ſtones of King <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> to build the temple of the Eternall, 1.<hi>Reg.</hi> 5. That which Pagans have ſpoken without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wee will ſpeake with reaſon and, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, That all ſorts of feare, is a fire in our ſoules, which ſcorcheth and conſumes us as long as it remaines there: But let us here ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour particularly, to conſider the Analogies and reſemblances, that there is betweene fire, and the feare of God, which is the ſubject of our text.</p>
               <p>Fire is a furious, haſtie, and active Element, and ſo likewiſe are the points of apprehenſion and feare; Fire is the cleaneſt, the pureſt, the wholſomeſt of all Elements; It cleanſeth, it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth, it drives out all filthineſſe and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as being neither able nor capable to ſuffer in it ſelfe any impurity, for it either conſumes, or expells it; And all this agrees well with the feare of God, which is the moſt wholſomeſt Phyſick that we can take to purge our ſelues of ſinne, and to purifie our hearts of all vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for there is no vice but it will purge and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2870:74"/>reject; Fire is an Element which conſumes and devoures all that is preſented to it, and the feare of God is a coale and flame, which devoureth all our concupiſcences.</p>
               <p>To make ſtraight a crooked peece of wood or timber, wee uſe fire, thereby to make it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more ſoft and flexible. So to replace ſoules in the way of life, when they are either crooked, or gone aſtray, in the by pathes of vice, then the feare of God, of all other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies is the beſt and moſt ſoveraigne.</p>
               <p>Fire (by <hi>Antiperiſtaſe</hi>) as it heates thoſe who are cold, ſo it refreſheth and comforteth thoſe who are hot; The feare of God heates and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames thoſe ſoules to doe well, who are moſt frozen in piety; and contrariwiſe, it cooleth thoſe who are moſt enflamed with their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſenſualities and concupiſcences.</p>
               <p>To venemous Apoſtumes, mortal Gangreens, and deſperate diſeaſes, wee for the laſt remedy apply Irons and fire to cure it.</p>
               <p>To ſinners inveterated in their wickedneſſe, and as it were deſpairing of their ſalvation, wee muſt apply the Iron and fire of the feare of God, to make them apprehend and know his divine judgements if they remaine impenitent, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentant.</p>
               <p>Hiſtorians report, that the Arabian Phoenix, (the onely bird of his race) is accuſtomed every five hundred yeares, to build an Artificiall neſt, whereunto the rayes of the Sunne reflecting and darting, it at one time reduceth to aſhes both
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2870:75"/>the worke and the workman: So if wee deſire to revive to the love of immortall beatitude and celeſtiall felicity, wee muſt ſet fire to our vices, by the art and flame of a true and lively repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and burne them all together in the feare of God.</p>
               <p>All the world is a field richly ſtrewed and diapred with the miracles and wonders of God, whereof man is the principall Maſter-peece, and the chiefeſt workmanſhip of his hands; and the ſacred Scriptures are as it were the Epitomie and Compendium thereof, wherein I every way ſee nothing but Gods love (of his ſide) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man; and read nothing but ſubjects of honour, and cauſes feare of man towards God; But among divers other places, I finde one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly agreeable and concurring with our text, which is <hi>Daniel Chap.</hi> 2.32. concerning the Statue which <hi>Nabuchadonozer</hi> ſaw in his dreame, <hi>The head of this Image was of fine gold, his breſt and armes of ſilver, his belly and thighes of braſſe, his legges of iron; his feete part of iron and part of clay, a ſtone was cut out without hands, which ſmote the Image upon his feete that were of iron, and brake them to peeces, and having broken them, the Statue fell backwards, and was reduced to Summer duſt.</hi> This Statue doth lively repreſent unto us a ſinner; By his golden head, I underſtand Pride, Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Ambition, which fumes and ſwims in the head of a ſinner, who eſteemes himſelfe as pretious as gold, and as rare as Pearles; His breſt and armes of ſilver, markes unto us his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2870:75"/>to covetouſneſſe, as having all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires every way bent and levelled to rapine and extortion; His belly and thighes of braſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents unto us his voluptuouſneſſe and inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety; His legges of iron ſhew us his cruelty; His feete of earth depaynts us his weakeneſſe and fragility; and this ſtone cut without hand from the mountaine of <hi>Sion,</hi> is the feare of God, which God caſts and rolles at our feete, to beat us to duſt, and to make us conſider the nothing from whence we came.</p>
               <p>The world, the fleſh and the devill (the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed mortall enemies of our ſoules, who will never want ſubtilty or malice to make us ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the way to life) ſeeing that this feare of God is a ſoveraigne Antidote againſt all the diſeaſes of the ſoule, not being able to diminiſh its vertue, by their artifice and deceipts, at leaſt they will make us loſe the relliſh thereof, by their inſinuations and perſwaſions, figuring us out this feare of God to be ſo hard, ſharpe, and bitter, that it is impoſſible for us to enjoy any reſt, or tranquillity of minde, as long as wee are poſſeſſed of that paſſion; That the wayes to heavenly <hi>Sion,</hi> are not ſo craggie and difficult, but that they are all paved with ſilke, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and contentments; But the faithfull man fearing God, ought to be as wiſe as a Serpent; Hee muſt ſtop his eares to this falſe Impoſter, and Inchanter, who would ſurpriſe him to ſtrangle him; Hee muſt remember the words which Chriſt Ieſus ſpake and dictated to him
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2870:76"/>by Saint <hi>Luke, Acts</hi> 14.22. <hi>We muſt thorow much tribulation enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> And againe by Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> 7.13. <hi>Enter yee in at the ſtrait gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, no, let us not flatter our ſelues there are no Roſes without prickles; we ſhall never obtaine and carie away the incorruptible Crowne of glory before wee have firſt fought the good fight, wee ſhall never put our foote in celeſtiall <hi>Canaan,</hi> before wee have firſt paſt the red ſea of the afflictions of this life, and departed forth of the wilderneſſe of our ſinnes; and in a word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have fought with the infernall Gyants and Devils, who ſtrive and endevour to prevent and hinder our entry thereinto.</p>
               <p>For it is abſolutely impoſſible, ever to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe or enjoy the love of God, here belowe in Earth, or much leſſe above in Heaven, before we have firſt ſworne to him, a perfect feare, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and obedience, <hi>Amoris Ianua timor est;</hi> The feare of God, is the entry and gate to his love, as alſo Love is a feare entermix'd with care and anxiety, <hi>Res est ſolliciti plena timoris amor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 19. Chap. verſe 4. of the 1. Booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> flying the perſecution of Queene <hi>Iezahel,</hi> being weary of his way, hee ſate downe &amp; ſlept under a Iuniper Tree, where an Angell came and found him out, and caried him a Cake baked upon coales, which hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly eate and reliſhed, and ſo ſatisfied his heart and ſtomacke for forty dayes and forty nights,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2870:76"/>after which they came to the mountaine of <hi>Oreb,</hi> the place of his refuge arid ſecurity. This <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> is the devill, and this Prophet may lively repreſent unto us our ſoule, which of all ſides is perſecuted by this cruell and implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, who flying his aſſaults, if ſhee come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her ſelfe under the ſharpe Iuniper of a truly holy and filiall feare; Then without doubt the Angell of Divine conſolations, will bring him the bread of Love, favour, and mercy, baked upon the coales of his affection, and the good will and clemency of God, which will then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh and repleniſh our hearts and ſoules during all the pilgrimage of this our mortall life, un till wee are arrived to the mountaine of <hi>Sion,</hi> which is the centre of our deſires, the reſidence of our delights, and the impregnable Fort and Caſtle of our felicities.</p>
               <p>I finde Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> compariſon to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellent and pretty, upon <hi>Feare and Love,</hi> and that we muſt paſſe thorow that, before wee can arrive to this; Hee ſayes, that feare is as a Needle, and Love as the ſilke which it drawes after it; The Needle is ſharpe, hard, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, but the ſilke is ſoft, faire, and pleaſing; Feare is indeede a ſharpe and diſtaſtfull paſſion, but that which doth ſweeten, lenifie, and cure his prickings; it is love which immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes it, being fraughted with courteſie, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and favour; Wee muſt not therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the ſmall ſtings of Bees, becauſe they afterwards promiſe to delight &amp; ſatiate us with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2870:77"/>their honey, which diſtills and flowes from the rocke of our ſalvation; And it is the Enigme of <hi>Sampſon</hi> to the Philiſtims; from the bitter came ſweet; from the rage and gall of the Lion, iſſued ſweet honey to delight and refreſh <hi>Sampſon;</hi> If Ieſus Chrivt (the true Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi>) had not endured for us the bitter and cruell death of the Croſſe, then wee had never taſted the excellent vertue of the honey of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: Indeed to fleſh and blood the <hi>Feare of God,</hi> is as it were a kinde of gall and bitterneſſe, becauſe it daunts, and out braves his paſſions, and it ſtill keepes him waking, as we doe to wild birds, thereby to tame him, and to make him quiet and docible; and ſo to inſtruct and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſe him to the ſervice of God. It ſtill ſhewes him the eminent dangers wherein ſhee will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulph &amp; precipitate him, in offending his God, but ſtill with an indulgent intent to prevent and hinder him from it, <hi>Pondus timor is est anchora cordis;</hi> The burthen which feare caries with it, is the hearts anchor; to prevent that it bee not reverſed, and overblowne by the waves, nor of all ſides ſplit and ſhipwrack'd by the violence and impetuoſity of tempeſtuous paſſions, which without intermiſſion aſſayle and beat upon it; <hi>But the mercy of the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>is from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation upon all thoſe who feare him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, (and ſo to draw to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) of this part of the Text, the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall pillars of Chriſtian Doctrine, and the two firme and vnremoveable foundations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2870:77"/>is <hi>Feare and Love,</hi> which are the two proper meanes to containe the godly, and to retaine the wicked in the obſervation of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; The wicked by <hi>Feare,</hi> the godly by Love, as the Poet ſpeakes, but morally, in a Chriſtian ſenſe and language:
<q>
                     <l>Oderunt peccare mali formidine Poenae.</l>
                     <l>Oderunt peccare boni, virtutis amore.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The wicked abhorre to offend for feare of puniſhment, and the Godly will not be drawne to ſinne, becauſe of their love of vertue.</p>
               <p>But here fearing leaſt I ſhould runne aſtray, and ſo loſe and ingulph my ſelfe in this great and vaſt Ocean of <hi>the feare of God,</hi> it makes mee rowe abord, thereby to gaine the deſired ſhore, and ſo to treat and diſcourſe of the ſecond part of the Text, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Honour the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two nobleſt and moſt excellent offices, which the Angels, and bleſſed ſoules enjoy above in the triumphant Church, are the viſion of God, and the ordinary action of glorifying and honouring God, about the which they are eternally imployed, and therefore the holy Ghoſt to faſhion and diſpoſe us here belowe in the militant Church, to glorifie in time his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſtie in heaven, commandeth us in our text likewiſe, to <hi>Honour the King,</hi> as being the true Image and lively repreſentation of that great King of glory, of the Father of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of the mighty God of Hoaſts, <hi>Feare God,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:2870:78"/>ſaith hee, and <hi>Honour the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divine, and altogether admirable words, as being the ſumme and abridgement of all the duties which we ought to practiſe in this world, both in body and ſoule, both for the morall and ſpirituall life, the performance whereof brings us to abſolute perfection; for if we feare God, wee ſerve him, and never offend him; and in honouring the King, beſides the performance of our duty, wee obey the Commaundement of God.</p>
               <p>So theſe 2. commandements are ſo ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly link'd and joyned together, that the breach of the one, is the violation of the other; for we cannot diſpleaſe the King, without offending God, nor offend God, without violating the Kings lawes.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee what that choſen veſſell ſaith, in very earneſt and preſſing words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Let every ſoule be ſubject to the higher powers, for there is no power but from God, and all authority is given from the Lord;</hi> which is the reaſon of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, followed preſently with a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; wherefore who ſo reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and therefore incurres condemnation, for the Prince beares not the ſword in vaine, ſeeing he is the ſervant and miniſter of God, to puniſh evill doers, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt ye be ſubject not onely for feare, but alſo for conſcience ſake; and therefore pay ye tribute, becauſe they are the miniſters of God ordained to that end, <hi>Give then unto every one
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2870:78"/>his due, tribute to whom tribute, cuſtome to whom cuſtome, feare to whom feare, and honour to whom honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we enter into an exact and particular expoſition of the words of our Text, wee will examine the conſequence of this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as thoſe who deſire to know the ſweetneſſe and goodneſſe of water, aſcend to fetch it from the ſpring, that wee may eſteeme the more the excellencie and greatneſſe of this commandement; we muſt obſerve, that this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is not made by men, either to flatter Kings, for feare of their ſoveraigne authority, but that it is Gods owne ordinance, dictated unto our Apoſtle by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Which brings great matter of conſolation, to thoſe who with zeale undertake the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, knowing that God loves thoſe that feare him, and bleſſeth thoſe that are obedient to him.</p>
               <p>And contrarily, it muſt greatly terrifie the diſobedient, when they remember the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble threatnings, and the irrevocable ſentence, pronounced by Gods owne ſacred mouth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Curſed is hee that breakes the leaſt of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> Math. 5.19. <hi>Curſed is hee that ſhall not be permanent in all the things written in the book of the law, to doe them,</hi> Deut. 27.26.</p>
               <p>We muſt againe note, that the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, are like the Sciences which are more or leſſe eſteemed, according to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and excellencie of their object, for as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2870:79"/>that affection and charity which we owe to our neighbour, without compariſon gives place to that extreame and infinite love which wee owe to our God, and heavenly Father; ſo the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we are to beare to all men in generall, is ſo much inferiour to that we owe the King, as his dignity is elevated above that of other men; and therefore you ſee, that as ſoone as our Apoſtle commandeth us to feare God, hee addeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, <hi>Honour the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shewing by that order, that the honour and ſervice due to the King, immediatly followes that which wee owe to God, and therefore a great ſervant of God of our times, expounding theſe words, ſaith after <hi>Tertullian,</hi> That in the performance of theſe two precepts, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian makes himſelfe perfect, both for the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and morall life, for in fearing God, hee walkes through the pathes of juſtice, holineſſe, and innocencie, which leades in the end to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall felicity.</p>
               <p>And in honouring the King, he obſerves his lawes, and by thoſe meanes buildeth up for himſelfe a delightfull reſt, and an incomparable felicity.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it is to undertake to ſayle over a boundleſſe and bottomleſſe Ocean, if we ſhould goe about to alledge here all the places which we might cite out of the Fathers, and many others; let us hearken to the holy Ghoſt, in the moſt common places of Scripturel, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Iſraelites, we will onely take ſome few
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2870:79"/>drops of water out of the land of <hi>Edow,</hi> and ſhew onely the ſprings afarre off; we will paſſe over quickly, like the dogge of the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> leaſt ſome Crocodile, thirſting after our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, ſhould open his ſtinking mouth to accuſe us, as though our intention were other, then tending to the ſervice and glory of God, which is the onely centre, unto the which all the lines of our intentions immediatly tend and ayme.</p>
               <p>Wee very eaſily learne the definition, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this word to <hi>Honour,</hi> in the 6. Chap of <hi>Eſther,</hi> when <hi>Ahaſhuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſh</hi> asked <hi>Haman</hi> what ſhould be done unto the man whom the King would honour; <hi>Haman</hi> thinking the King ſpake ſo for him, invented all the wayes and meanes hee could, to enjoy and encreaſe this honour; therefore he anſwered the King thus, As for the man whom the King will honour, let them bring for him royall apparell, which the King uſeth to weare, and the horſe that the King ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth upon, and that the crowne royall may be ſet upon his head, and that one of the greateſt Princes ſhould goe before him, and proclaime, <hi>Thus ſhall it he done unto the man whom the King will honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this ample deſcription of <hi>Honour,</hi> we note the definition of it; to wit, to give glory, to doe homage to any one, to ſeeke all the meanes that may be to advance his credit, and encreaſe his reputation through all the world, and thus that curſed <hi>Haman</hi> thought to be honoured.</p>
               <p>But this word to <hi>Honour the King,</hi> in that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2870:80"/>ſenſe that our Apoſtle takes it, is like to that honour mentioned in the firſt Commandement of the ſecond table, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy mother,</hi> which ſignifieth in generall, to ſerve, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, obey, aſſiſt thoſe whom wee honour, and of that reverence, obedience, and aſſiſtance, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh expreſly, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The Elders that rule well, are worthy of a double honour,</hi> where obſerve and note, that by the firſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, hee underſtandeth a civill and common honour, like that which is due to other honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men; but by the ſecond honour hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth a ſubvention, and reward of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as it appeareth by the following words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muſle the mouth of the Oxe that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the come, and the labourer is worthy of his wages,</hi> Luk. 10.7.</p>
               <p>And of all theſe foure duties which wee are to practiſe, to <hi>honour the King,</hi> is ſpoken at large, 1. <hi>Sam. Chap.</hi> 8. When the Iſraelites did ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire him to give them a King, hee doth lively ſet forth unto them, how perfectly they muſt be ſubject to him, how they muſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him, how they muſt obey him.</p>
               <p>But becauſe commonly among good corne there be tares, or ſome other bad ſeed, we will ſhew by expreſſe words of Scripture, and by invincible reaſons, <hi>That hee that obeyeth not to the higher powers, offendeth directly God himſelfe, who will deſtroy him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Put them in remembrance that they be ſubject to principalities, and powers, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2870:80"/>that they be obedient, and ready to every good worke.</hi>

               <p>And <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>The Prince is the Miniſter of of God for thy good, but if thou doe evill, the feare,</hi> for he beareth not the ſword for nought, for he is the Miniſter of God, to execute juſtice on him that doth evill; therefore ye muſt bee ſubject, not for feare onely, but alſo for conſcience ſake; wherefore thoſe that reſiſt the power, reſiſt the ordinance of God, and thoſe that reſiſt this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, drawes on themſelues condemnation.</p>
               <p>But if theſe rules bee not ſtrong enough to convert thoſe preverſe men; at leaſt let them be frighted by the fearefull judgements which fell on ſo many wicked men, which aunciently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> their Prince &amp; Soveraigne, who by Gods commaund had deliuered them from the hands of <hi>Pharao,</hi> the cruelleſt of men, and had led and conducted them with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wiſedome into the wilderneſſe; let them ſet before their eyes the example of <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> who with two hundred and fifty Princes of the Iſraelites, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.2. rebelled againſt their Prince; but God avenger of their folly, cauſed the earth to open her mouth, and to ſwallow them up alive with their families, <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> his owne Nephewes, becauſe they had not obeyed him, were conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with their fellowes by fire, that went out from the Altar, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.2. and his owne ſiſter <hi>Marie,</hi> for ſpeaking undiſcreetly of him, was by the Lord infected with leproſie, what ſhall wee ſay of <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> and <hi>Abſalom,</hi> againſt King <hi>David,</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:2870:81"/>the Hiſtory of whoſe deſtruction and confuſion is ſo well knowne, that wee neede not inſiſt upon it.</p>
               <p>But here are yet very expreſſe words, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Thou ſhalt not rayle upon the Iudges, neither ſpeake evill of the ruler of thy people.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 23. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeake ill of thy Prince, of him that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe theſe lawes and examples like waves of the Sea follow one another, wee will inſiſt on the conſideration of the horror of this crime, which cannot take place in a ſoule never ſo little endued with heavenly graces; for that heart muſt be deſperately wicked, and that ſoule poſſeſſed with a thouſand furies, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the leaſt thought of it to harbour in his will; that ſoule, I ſay, muſt not onely be voyd of reaſon, but worſe then bruit beaſts, who without contradiction follow and obey their Kings: The birds yeeld to the Eagle, the fiſhes follow the Dolphin, and the beaſts are pliant and humble before the Lyon; and ſhould man that is made after Gods image, be worſe then all other living creatures? This is to be neither man nor beaſt, but the off-ſpring of thoſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſpirits, which rebelled in heaven againſt God, and therefore received the puniſhment due to their fooliſh ambition in hell; but wee will no longer ſtay out contemplation about theſe deteſtable men, hoping that our age is not ſo unhappy as to be corrupted by them.</p>
               <p>But we will now ſpeake of the reward, profit,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2870:81"/>and recompence, which thoſe ſhall certainely receive that obey this commandement of God, in <hi>honouring the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Interpreters of the law of God, with one conſent agree, that the firſt commandement of the ſecond table, to wit, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> is to be underſtood of all them that have any power or dominion over us, and chiefely of Kings, and Princes, to whom wee are ſubject, and to whom wee owe both our lives and goods; and beſides, that all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of that opinion, yet we alſo ſee it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the 13. Chap. to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> where the Apoſtle teaching the faithfull all the lawes which they muſt obſerve; hee runnes over all the Commandements of God, and yet ſpeakes not of this word <hi>Father,</hi> becauſe hee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth it ſufficiently under that of <hi>King,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Father is King in his Family, and the King is the Father of his people.</p>
               <p>As for that objection, that there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of a King in the Decalogue, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is cleare and manifeſt; firſt, the Iſraelites had no neede of it, becauſe God did every day appeare viſibly unto them, ſpake to them at all times, and wrought continually ſo many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles among them, that they could not be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his preſence; ſecondly, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made neither of Governour, nor of Prince, and yet it is unlikely that God had forgotten <hi>Moſes,</hi> who had delivered them, before God wrote the Law with his owne finger on the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2870:82"/>mountaine of <hi>Sinai;</hi> but the reaſon is, that by the word <hi>Father,</hi> God underſtandeth, as well Kings and Princes, as thoſe that have begotten us; all the curſes made againſt the rebellious, and diſobedient to this commandement, are common both to the rebellious to their Prince, and to the diſobedient to their Father; as on the contrary, thoſe that are obedient to both, ſhall bee equally rewarded with the ſame bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and the promiſe made to them by God, who doe honour their parents, is alſo to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to thoſe who honour their Kings, and Princes, which promiſe is happineſſe, and length of dayes upon the land.</p>
               <p>Which promiſe (though it often ſeeme other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) is alwayes fulfilled, for when an obedient ſonne to his father, or a faithfull ſubject to his Prince dieth young, and in the flower of his age God nevertheleſſe accompliſheth his word, and fulfilleth truely his promiſe; for if it bee good for the faithfull to remaine in the land, GOD will make him abundantly to proſper therein; but if his admirable and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible providence, ſee that hee ſhould be ſundry wayes grievouſly afflicted, he often times put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him in ſafety, and calleth him unto him in his mercy, and yet hee is ſtill as good as his word, as if a man pomiſed mee a hundred pounds, and ſhould give me three hundred, hee thereby breakes not his promiſe; ſo God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſed us here belowe the poſſeſſion of this world, and ſeeing that our dwelling in it is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2870:82"/>not for our profit, bereaving us of this, hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth us into the incorruptible Kingdome of glory, more excellent without compariſon then the firſt, and ſo whether hee let us dwell here belowe, or whether hee call us above to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, we ſhall alwayes be in a moſt happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if we obey his commandement, in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word, and dignity of a King is ſo knowne, and familiar to all kinde of nations, that we ſhould ſeeme to light a candle at noone day, to ſee the light of the Sunne, if wee ſhould exactly ſeeke out the definitions, and Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of it.</p>
               <p>We will onely ſay with Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in the Citie of God, that the name of <hi>King</hi> is the auncienteſt title, given to the Governours, and Rulers of peoples, yea, when the earth devoyd of all ambition, enjoyed the ſweetneſſe and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of an ineſtimable peace.</p>
               <p>For as <hi>Non minor est virtus, quàm quaerere, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta tucri,</hi> There is no leſſe vertue in conſerving then in purchaſing; ſo you ſee that the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableſt of the Auncients, have provided for their conſervation in chuſing Kings and Princes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe ſhadowe they enjoyed quiet reſt, for the Kingdome being as a body, the King muſt alwayes be the head, which being ſeated on the top, and elevated over the reſt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, hee fore-ſeeth the dangers to avoyd them, and conſidereth the advantages to embrace them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:2870:83"/>Now as in the head is ſeene the glory, and beauty of man, according to theſe auncient verſes.</p>

               <p>All living creatures alwayes behold the earth, but God hath made and erected mans face, that he might behold the heaven, and the ſtarres; even ſo muſt we conſider the beauty of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in the Kings face and Majeſtie, as being the head thereof.</p>
               <p>As you ſee that all the ſenſes both internall and externall are ſeated, and take their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the head; ſo all the counſells, all the reſolutions, juſtice, the lawes, in a word, all that is neceſſary for the Kingdomes conſervation, is all to be found in the <hi>King,</hi> as in his center, and in the place whence they take their beginning.</p>
               <p>Let us then examine particularly, ſince wee have a Royall ſubject in hand, all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by which the King in compariſon of his ſubjects, is juſt as the head is over the reſt of the members, wherein reaſon holdeth her Aſſizes and Seſſions, the better to governe this <hi>Microcoſme,</hi> or little world.</p>
               <p>The two chiefeſt and nobleſt faculties of the ſoule, are the Vnderſtanding, and the Will: the ſame which we note in the ſoule, wee may alſo marke to be in the King, which is as it were the ſoule of the people, for as from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding proceede the counſels, reſolutions, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2870:83"/>enterpriſes, needfull for the conſervation of mans body; even ſo from the King proceedes the meanes, and inventions for the right, and juſt government of his Realme; As by the Will, wee ſee that man accepteth thoſe things which are good, and rejecteth thoſe that are hurtfull; even ſo the King, by his wonderfull prudence, and wiſedome ſeeketh what is good, profitable to his ſubjects, &amp; contrarily rejecteth and preventeth whatſoever is hurtfull and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to them.</p>
               <p>In a word, as all the parts of the body, and all the appetites of the ſoule, ſtirre according to the motion of the will; ſo the people ſhould never have any other deſire, thought, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the deſire, thought, and deſigne of their King, who is the Lords anointed, ſent by God to adminiſter Iuſtice, and to governe his people in Equity, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 46.10.</p>
               <p>The hands of Kings are like that divine ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which compaſſed about the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and being divided into foure branches, communicated to the hearbs, and plants of that incloſure, a continuall moyſture, and which was altogether moſt wonderfull and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, in that thoſe foure brookes, beſides the excellent ſweetneſſe of their water, were well ſtored, ſome with fine gold, and others with precious ſtones.</p>
               <p>With infinite right and reaſon, may we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compare the hands and actions of Kings,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2870:84"/>to this undraynable ſpring and river of the earthly Paradiſe, ſince they are imployed about nothing elſe, but lovingly to cheriſh and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Subjects by liberally diſtributing, and communicating to them the meanes of their ſubſiſtance and proſperity.</p>
               <p>But leaſt wee ſhould be carried away, by the ſwift ſtreame of the many ſeverall cogitations, which ariſe from ſo royall a ſubject; let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to our former diſcourſe, to wit, that the King being to his people, as the head is to the reſt of the body, all the rare and admirable parts contayned therein, as the internall and externall ſenſes, ought juſtly to bee compared to him.</p>
               <p>And firſt, that <hi>Senſe</hi> by precedencie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, which the Philoſophers call <hi>Common,</hi> that is, that which receives all the objects of the externall ſenſes, to bring the ſpecies of them to the phantaſie, and what is the King elſe but this common ſenſe, ſince he is profitable to all, he receiveth the objects, that is the wiſhes, and petitions of all, to convay them to the phantaſie, that is, to his imaginative and mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there to conſult and reſolve, what is good, uſefull, honeſt, needfull, and profitable for his ſuppliants and people.</p>

               <p>The examples of it are yet now a dayes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, that Kings and Princes give their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular poſſeſſions to their Subjects, on condition of ſome yeerely acknowledgement, which they are obliged to, according to their agreement and conventions.</p>
               <p>Againe, there is no Kingdome in the world but hath beene ſometimes conquered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all the lands thereof are abſolutely in the Conquerours hand, to diſpoſe of at his pleaſure; now it is the cuſtome of a new and victorious Prince, to beſtowe them on whom he pleaſeth, alwayes reſerving to himſelfe ſome tribute, or homage for it, that the remembrance of his liberall favour may never be forgotten.</p>
               <p>Againe, we reade not that thoſe which went to ſeeke new habitations, did goe confuſedly, and diſorderly, and in equall authority, but they
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2870:85"/>went all under the colours and conduct of ſome chiefe, which afterwards became the King and Prince of that land, the which hee diſtributed according to the deſerts or affection which hee bare to his ſouldiers.</p>
               <p>So we reade <hi>Numb.</hi> 34.

               <p>The Apoſtles had nothing, and yet poſſeſſed all the riches of the faithfull, of whom they were as Kings and Princes, and therfore in ſigne of acknowledgement, all the new Chriſtians brought their goods to their feet, <hi>Acts</hi> Chap. 5. for who would not deſpiſe all his wealth for love; <hi>If a man ſhould give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love, they would greatly contemne it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, Cantic.</hi> 8.7.</p>
               <p>But what horrible ingratitude would that be in him that ſhould doe otherwiſe, ſeeing that paines, care, and unquietneſſe follow common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Scepter, and that there is no burthen ſo heavie as a Crowne, and the reaſon hereof is manifeſt; to wit, that a private and particular

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2870:87"/>reaſons againſt us, before we thought upon our owne defence, to enter into combat with them, have cut one anothers throat, and have left us their Armes to make trophees for this our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; for thinking to make a buckler for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that place of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> wher he exhorteth us to beare the yoake, and <hi>to ſubmit our ſelves unto all manner of ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King or Supreame,</hi> 1. Pet. 2.13. This reaſon killeth them, for if it be for the Lords ſake, that we muſt be ſubject, it argueth that God liketh it, delighteth in it; and this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is by his command and ſpeciall ordinance.</p>
               <p>Although <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> were one of the moſt wicked and impious men of the earth, yet let us heare how the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaketh to him, in the ſecond Chapter of his Propheſies, <hi>O King, thou art the King of Kings, for the God of heaven hath given thee a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, ſtrength, and glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I would have theſe diſturbers of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique tranquillity; theſe Adders ſwelled and ſuffocated with the venome of ſedition, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, tell me, whether <hi>Moſes</hi> the firſt Prince and Lawgiver of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (the names change not the things, for he was their King and Monarch, ſince hee ruled them with an abſolute power, depending onely from God) whether, I ſay, he entered by force, by craft, or by art into the government of the people; and if it was not God himſelfe that ſpake to him out of the middeſt of the burning buſh, and commanded
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2870:88"/>him to goe deliver his people from the hands of <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Saul</hi> thought to adorne his head with a Crowne, when hee ſought about the fields the Aſſes of <hi>Kis</hi> his father, if he made ſuit to <hi>Samuel</hi> to anoint him King over all <hi>Iſrael;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>David</hi> when he fed his flocke, meditated how hee might change his Shepheards crooke into a regall Scepter;</p>
               <p>If <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſonne, the King of wiſe men, and the wiſeſt of Kings, hath deceived or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the people, to enter by the windowes, or back gate into the kingly Pallace.</p>
               <p>But rather is it not God himſelfe, who by his ſacred mouth commanded <hi>Samuel</hi> in the 9. Chapter of his booke, as ſoone as he had ſeene <hi>Saul</hi> that went to enquire of him about his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Aſſes, at the ſame time God ſaid unto him, <hi>This is the man of whom I ſpake unto thee, he ſhall rule over my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the 16. Chapter of the ſame booke, God commaunded him to goe to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to anoint <hi>David,</hi> whom hee choſe among all his brethren, the Lord ſaying unto him, <hi>Ariſe and anoint him, for this is he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame booke, God promiſeth <hi>Davia</hi> to confirme his ſonne upon his Throne.</p>
               <p>And in the 1. of <hi>Kings,</hi> Chap. 3. God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Salomon</hi> in a dreame in <hi>Gabaon,</hi> preſently after his Coronation, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Aske what then wilt, that I give thee;</hi> A ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, that God was well pleaſed with his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2870:88"/>to the Royall throne, and <hi>Salomon</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him onely wiſedome to governe his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, God ſaid, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt not asked of mee riches, glory, nor power, I will give thee what thou askeſt me, and other things beſides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee reade 2. <hi>Kings,</hi> Chapter 9. that <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> ſendeth one of the children of the Prophets to <hi>Iehu,</hi> one of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Captaines, to anoint him from the Lord King over <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.7. <hi>To come to preferment is neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South, but God is the Iudge, he it is that humbleth and exalteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 113.7. <hi>The Lord raiſeth the needie out of the duſt, and lifteth up the poore out of the dung, that hee may ſet him with the Princes, even with the Princes of his people:</hi> Wee might alledge many other examples, and proofes out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but theſe are ſufficient to proove our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
               <p>It is an erronious and damnable opinion to hold, that Kings come to the Crowne by fraud, force, or ſucceſſion, without the Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſacred decree, for one haire of our head falleth not,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.74.</note> without the providence of God, much more a thing of ſo great a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as the eſtabliſhing of a King over the Provinces of a Kingdome, and over ſo many millions of men, that are bound to ſweare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him. I ſay not onely, that his comming to the Crowne is ordered by Gods generall providence; but moreover, that it is his ſpeciall intention and deſigne, that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2870:89"/>made him aſcend the Throne.</p>
               <p>Let vs hearken to the wiſedome of GOD, <hi>Prov.</hi> Chapter 8. &amp;c. after wee ſhall ſee if it be fraud, force, or ſucceſſion, which are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and wayes, by the which they aſcend unto that dignity; <hi>By me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, true God, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſentiall with his Father, under the name of that wiſedome) <hi>Kings raigne, and Princes decree justice, By me Princes rule, and the Nobles, and all the Iudges of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaketh very pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and manifeſtly upon this ſubject, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord unto</hi> Cyrus <hi>his anointed, whoſe right hand I have holden, to ſubdue nations before him, therefore will I weaken the loynes of Kings, and ſhut; I will goe before thee, and make the crooked wayes ſtreight, I will breake the braſen doores, and burſt the iron barres; I girded thee, though thou haſt not knowne me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> Chap. 27. ſpeaketh ſo openly, that hee alone is ſufficient to ſtop thoſe prophane and ſeditious mouthes. Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes, <hi>I have given all theſe lands into the hand of</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>the King of Babel, my ſervant, and all nations ſhall ſerue him, and his ſonne, and his ſonnes ſonne, and the nation, and Kingdome which will not ſerue the ſame</hi> Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar <hi>King of Babel, and that put not their necke under the yoake of the King of Babel, the ſame nation will I viſite</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>with the ſword, and with the famine, and with the peſtilence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2870:89"/>heare not your Prophets, nor your Southſayers, nor your dreamers, nor your inchanters, nor your Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, which ſay unto you thus, Ye ſhall not ſerue the King of Babel, for they propheſie a lye unto you, to cauſe you to goe farre from your land, and that I ſhould caſt you out, and you ſhould periſh, but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that put their necks under the yoake of the King of Babel, an ſerue him; thoſe will I let remaine ſtill in their owne land, ſaith the Lord, and they ſhall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie it, and dwell therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Words worthy of a great and profound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and which totally deſides, and cuts off that queſtion, which we now have in hand, for it is God himſelfe that ſpeaketh to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ſtrictly chargeth them to obey the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> into whoſe hands he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them; and although hee was an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and unfaithfull King, yet they will obey him, on paine of his curſe and malediction; what judgements, what puniſhments ſhould we much more cauſe to fall upon us, if the leaſt thought of rebellion, or diſobedience to the Lords anointed ſhould enter into our mindes, if we were not perfectly obedient to Kings, who are good, faithfull, and zealous to further the glory of God, if our hearts and our mouthes be not alwayes filled with prayers, and vowes dedicated to their ſervice.</p>
               <p>But to the end that imitating <hi>Hercules,</hi> wee may clenſe &amp; ſweepe cleane this Augean ſtable, wee will anſwere to that objection propounded touching <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who hath been the firſt King
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2870:90"/>of the earth, who (ſay they) hath attained to the crowne by force, and by violence, words which we finde not in the Scripture; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily we read, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 10.8. that <hi>Cuſh</hi> begat <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> who began to be mighty in the earth, hee was a mighty Hunter before the Lord. Theſe words will never oblige us to conclude, that hee hath raiſed himſelfe violently; but wee may more truely expound the wordes, <hi>Hee was mighty before the Lord,</hi> that is, he was lifted up to greatneſſe by the moſt High, hee walked in his wayes, and followed his ordinances; and when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he began to be mighty in the earth,</hi> he meaneth, that hee was more feared then his predeceſſours, who were alſo Kings, Prieſts, and ſoveraigne Princes of their families: For after the generall deluge, which overflowed the whole earth, men lived commonly five or ſixe hundred yeares, and ſo one of his poſterity might ſee aboue a hundred thouſand perſons, over whom he was Prince, and ſoveraigne Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, becauſe there was then no other forme of government in the earth; ſo we reade <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 23. Chap. that the Hittites, of whom <hi>Abraham</hi> asked a Sepulchre to bury <hi>Sara,</hi> theſe I ſay cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him a Prince of God, or a moſt excellent Prince, which hee clearely manifeſted at the overthrow of the five Kings, which had beaten the King of <hi>Sodome,</hi> had pillaged the Towne, and carried away his Nephew <hi>Lot</hi> priſoner, for at the rumour of theſe ſorrowfull newes, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med three hundred and eighteene of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2870:90"/>borne in his houſe, and yet had no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>It is then in vaine to alledge, that violence, craft, and hereditary ſucceſſion, are the onely meanes to attaine to Crowes; for although ſome attaine to it by humane meanes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by dangerous wayes, as <hi>Abſalom,</hi> who cauſed himſelfe to be anointed King by expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Father, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> by the death of 70 of his brethren upon the ſame ſtone; yet for all theſe wayes to come to raigne, are never brought to paſſe, without a manifeſt fore-ſight, and providence of God, permitting it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to puniſh thoſe peoples, and ſometimes for a puniſhment to the Kings that raigne over them; yet whatſoever they be, God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to obey, and perfectly to honour them: now curſed, curſed be he that ſhall reſiſt the will of God, and that ſhall not obey his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
               <p>After we haue heard both Scripture, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, manifeſtly evincing the truth, Let us now heare Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion in this matter, in his booke <hi>De civit. Dei.</hi> The cauſe (ſaith he) of the greatneſſe of Empires, is neither caſuall, nor fatall, it commeth neither by chance, nor by deſtinie; By chance I underſtand (ſaith he) the things that happen; we not being able to know the cauſes of them, or that happen without any premeditated order of reaſon, aſſiſting their conception and birth: By fatall things I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand (as Pagans eſteeme) what happeneth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2870:91"/>the will of God, and men, by the neceſſity of ſome particular order; which opinion is greatly injurious to Gods divine providence, but rather wee muſt certainely beleeve, that Kingdomes are conſtituted, and eſtabliſhed ſimply, and abſolutely by the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.</p>
               <p>And in another place, Let us not attribute the power of giving, or diſpoſing of an Empire, but onely to the true God, that giveth eternall happineſſe in heaven to his children onely; but for earthly Kingdomes, he giveth them to good and bad, as it ſeemeth good to him, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, who is delighted in no unjuſt thing; therefore this true and onely God, that alwayes provideth mankinde, both with ayde and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, when he would, and as long as he pleaſed, hath given the governement, and Empire to the people of <hi>Rome;</hi> hee is the giver of all felicity, that giveth earthly Kingdomes to whom hee pleaſeth, and yet alwayes with juſtice and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though the meanes ſeeme to us oftentimes manifeſtly contrary to both.</p>
               <p>I thinke we have employed too much time, and too many good weapons, to fight againſt this horrible monſter, and monſtrous Hydra, and therefore the ſhorteſt and ſureſt way, is to follow the example of that valiant <hi>Hercules,</hi> and ſo to cut off this monſter, for hee that will not heare the Scripture, ſo manifeſtly ſhewing unto us our duty to our Kings, that ſo expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to yeeld unto them all obedience,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2870:91"/>hee that ſtoppeth his eares to thoſe ſweet and moſt gracious invitations of reaſon, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination, to honour and ſerue him, whom the bounty and will of GOD hath eſtabliſhed over us; He who watcheth in labour, to make us ſleepe in reſt; Hee who ſits on the throne to doe us right, that to eaſe us, beareth the burthen of all our affaires; and in a word, Hee whoſe minde is alwayes in trouble and anxiety, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the quietneſſe of his people, and to keepe off the invaſion and tyrannie of Strangers; thoſe Subjects, I ſay, are worthy of all the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, diſaſters, and calamities which can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, through the privation of ſo good things.</p>
               <p>But wee, who by the grace of GOD are brought up in his Schoole, that together with our mothers milke have ſucked the honour, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and obedience which wee owe to our Kings and Princes; Let us not ſuffer thoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and dangerous plagues, to infect the purity of our hearts, and let not the whiteneſſe of our ſoules be ſpotted and defiled, by ſo blacke and venomous a crime, aſſuring our ſelves, that the leaſt thought of diſobedience and rebellion, which poſſeſſeth the minde; beſides, that it is an evident token of an ungodly minde, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the moſt ſevere puniſhments that can be imagined.</p>
               <p>But let us ſhew, that we are begotten among the children of GOD, and regenerated by the Spirit of his grace, let our ambition never flye higher then to the execution of his ſacred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2870:92"/>wherein lyeth the fulneſſe and centre of all delights, and of all felicity both ſpirituall and temporall, and ſince particularly he deſireth, that we ſhould feare him, and <hi>honour the King,</hi> which he hath eſtabliſhed over us, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in the accompliſhed, and fulfilling of theſe two commandements, we have as it were the ſumme of all his law; let us be carefull to honour &amp; ſerve him, and to yeeld unto him all ſorts of duties, for he is the Lords anointed, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring our ſelves, that whileſt we ſhall ſtudie to yeeld unto him due obedience, whileſt we pray fervently for his long life, and proſperity, as we are in duty bound, God for his part will make good unto us his promiſes; to wit, to make us enjoy a delightfull reſt, and an admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, to bleſſe the land wherein we dwell, to multiply our dayes upon it, in joy and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and after we ſhall have ſerved, obeyed, and and honoured the King, hee will call us unto eternall felicity, to crowne us with the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Crowne of glory, that ſeated with the 24 Elders, in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> we may with them caſt downe our crownes before him, who is ſet on the Throne, to ſing before him altogether: O Lord, thou art worthy to receive honour, bleſſing, and glory; to thee therefore, O eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, immortall, admirable, to thee onely wiſe God, Creator of all things, be aſcribed all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, glory, and magnificence, now and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evermore. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
